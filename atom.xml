  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#A&quot;&gt;WebSummit. Is that time of the year?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;newsceil&quot;&gt;News.ceil&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;squidgame-crypto-goes-busscam&quot;&gt;SquidGame crypto goes bus…scam.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure that you’ve been exposed to the cryptocurrency world at this point, and there’s a good chance that you have already bought a few crypto coins here and there. This one is just another example of pseudo currencies’ problems, especially in such a volatile and unregulated market. &lt;a href=&quot;https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/01/investing/squid-game-cryptocurrency-scam/index.html&quot;&gt;The Squid Game inspired cryptocurrency revealed to be a scam&lt;/a&gt;. “Pump and dump” scams abound in the crypto world, and event the late Mr Mcafee was involved on a few, as we’ve mentioned here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ibm-buys-macdonalds-ai-pie&quot;&gt;IBM buys MacDonalds AI pie.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/en-us/our-stories/article/ourstories.IBM-McD-Tech-Labs.html&quot;&gt;MacDonals decided to sell McD Tech Labs to IBM for an undisclosed value&lt;/a&gt;. The move shifts gears for the automatic order taking system development that has been dragging since 2019 after the acquisition of the voice recognition startup Apprente. Whether it is with IBM or another AI powerhouse, this was an excellent move since we see many AI projects from non-tech companies go bust too quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fifa-nftswho-would-have-guessed&quot;&gt;FIFA NFTs…who would have guessed.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-59167668&quot;&gt;In a recent investor call, Mr Andrew Wilson, EA’s CEO, pointed out that NFTs are a pillar for the gaming industry’s future within the FIFA franchise&lt;/a&gt;. EA is hinting for FIFA games without the governing body at their back while the latter already announced the split of their exclusive deal with EA. It’s going to get heated in some courts, for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;getting-physical-before-the-metaverse&quot;&gt;Getting Physical before the Metaverse.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meta, formerly known as Facebook, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/05/technology/facebook-stores-meta-metaverse.html&quot;&gt;is working on a project to open physical stores&lt;/a&gt; before the Metaverse arrival. The idea was rolling well before Meta’s announcement, but it could support AR/VR equipment demo centres to metaverse punters. After so many dystopian movies and books, I can only imagine shelters for people unable to buy expensive equipment to participate in the humanity pseudo sublimation. A Videodrome future might be right around the corner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;big-particles-accelerator&quot;&gt;Big Particles Accelerator.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After listening about this endeavour, I was almost betting that it was something backed by Mr Elon Musk. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spinlaunch.com/&quot;&gt;SpinLaunch&lt;/a&gt;, an American startup based in California, tries to put objects in orbit, skipping the cumbersome rocket launchers and spinning the objects to escape velocity.
Backed by impressive investors, including Google ventures, Spinlaunch is showing promising results with their first tests. What a loonshot!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;no-free-lunch-but-java-is-on-oracles-tab-again&quot;&gt;No free lunch, but Java is on Oracle’s tab again.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oracle is reverting their 2018 contentious decision of making developers pay for the JDK.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infoq.com/news/2021/10/oracle-jdk-free-again&quot;&gt;From version 17 forward, SDKs are free&lt;/a&gt;, but companies can still keep their subscriptions for premium support.
Oracle’s official JVM lost many users in these last few years while OpenJDK distributions from Amazon, Microsoft and others gained traction, replacing Oracle’s JVMs in many production environments. The move might not be enough to regain lost clients, and I believe we’ll see more initiatives from Oracle to put their JDKs running in developers machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;portugal-is-on-the-world-news&quot;&gt;Portugal is on the world news.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, it wasn’t Websummit.
This isn’t directly related to tech, but since many of us are embarking on the remote lifestyle, it will significantly impact it.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://slashdot.org/story/21/11/09/2124228/portugal-makes-it-illegal-for-your-boss-to-text-you-after-work&quot;&gt;The Portuguese government ruled out a set of laws that will protect workers from being contacted outside their regular work hours&lt;/a&gt;. The ruling was echoed by many media outlets and most with a positive view about the decision.
How many of us tech workers are plagued with an unofficial 24/7 schedule? Probably many.
How many companies will get cold feet hiring people that at the minimum work friction might pull the “out of hours communication” lever? Time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-about-a-clippy-avatar&quot;&gt;What about a Clippy avatar?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While former Facebook, now Meta, made a splash with their rebranding and Metaverse plans, Microsoft is easing their VR technologies. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jd2GK0qDtRg&quot;&gt;Microsoft Mesh&lt;/a&gt; was announced in March, well before Meta and with a small fanfare. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/62d4652f-faec-4ef7-b642-1ae7b4262563&quot;&gt;Now, the company plans to roll out their AR/VR technologies in their office collaboration platform Teams&lt;/a&gt;. Making Clippy, the default avatar should be their next step :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;websummit-is-that-time-of-the-year-already&quot;&gt;WebSummit. Is that time of the year already?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;november-12th&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;November 12th&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;” This is the last Websummit that I’ll visit while an ‘attendee’ “.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said it thrice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year I was about to comply with my statement but, once again, the allure of a free ticket made me visit the tech conference/startup fair that the Portuguese government subsidized for ten years. While I’m starting this piece with a sour tone, it’s not all bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After getting the news that Multivision got a bundle of free tickets to this year edition, my promise faltered instantly. One knows it’s never free, and in this case, we would need to go through a commercial presentation to sell us the 2022 edition. We’ve dodged that bullet, and some of us got to visit one of the largest tech conferences in the world, or so they tell us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My professional and personal schedule weren’t aligned with the dates, but I still got a day of the three and a half-day conference. Three and a half days because the event starts at the end of a day with some presentations and the Night Summit, an informal gathering spread around in multiple venues on Lisbon for attendees, VCs and entrepreneurs to mingle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re from out of town and your company paid full for the trip, this year must have been excellent. With a smaller attendee list of around 42K tech denizens, there was ample space to go to every booth and speak with entrepreneurs or peers without getting smothered by the passing crowd. Lisbon is also recouping tourism but still running half full, which provides less hassle in every visit to a restaurant, store, hotel or riverside park.
But if you’re an entrepreneur looking for funding and customers, this year wasn’t great with less 30K visitors since 2019’s edition. There was less foot traffic to see the small startup booths spread over the four LIF pavilions, or Lisbon International Fair, at Parque das Nações.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My day usually starts early, and I could get to the venue well before any speakers got on stage. Even so, there was a steady visitor stream going through the motions at the checkpoints and main entrance. I still had to register for the event, but it didn’t take more than 20 minutes from the first checkpoint until I got inside the venue. If you’d arrive a couple hours later, you had to wait for more than one hour as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/nchattinl/&quot;&gt;Ms Nicole Chattin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/raquel-albuquerque-409053157/&quot;&gt;Ms Raquel Albuquerque&lt;/a&gt; did, two of my colleagues that also went to the event.
After getting inside, it looked like a ghost town compared with previous editions, and for an attendee that wanted to browse booths, it was great. With a cup of coffee in hand, I got to see the booth set of the day from beginning to end without having to compromise my attention with a relentless current of patrons.
Again, I didn’t plan well this visit and was completely unprepared for the day. Nevertheless, right after getting in, I could find a comfortable place to sit and launch Websummit’s mobile app with the multiple stage talk calendar, and I got pleasant surprises.
From a conversation between Ms Rebecca Parsons, ThoughtWorks CTO, with Christine Spang, Co-founder and CTO at Nylas, to the AWS Lounge with an excellent presentation about the Cloud Development Kit, or just CDK, I almost got a perfect setup of talks on nearby stages.
The app is your map, calendar and social network for the event’s duration and one of Ms Raquel Albuquerque Websummit favourite features. If you ever want to visit or come back, set it up early before the event. Make your choices and get soon to the venues, or else you’ll miss precious spots in more space-constrained events, such as the CDK presentation that I had to attend outside the AWS Lounge or the ones that Ms Chattin and Ms Raquel lost since the venue was already full. The early bird gets the worm, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have never visited a tech event of this size, you don’t know how important it is to plan for the talks and venues to see inside. Although this edition was less complete than the previous ones, you still need to negotiate trips between pavillions from one session to the other. A foot trip can take five to ten minutes which can be enough to lose half of a session that takes twenty minutes. I got lucky this time, even when switching stages was a breeze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Portugal, we use a pair of expressions to mark the dichotomy between good and bad business years. A good business year gets an “It’s a fat cow season” while a bad business year will get the expression “It’s a thin cow season”. The latter applied perfectly to this year brand booths. Fewer goodies and gift bags to spread around. Some booths didn’t even have any representatives for a big chunk of the day. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://eco.sapo.pt/&quot;&gt;ECO&lt;/a&gt;, a Portuguese digital-only business newspaper, the impact of every edition since 2016 was much lower than expected, with a total gross added value of 252 million euros when the total predicted was 448 million euros. Just for comparison, a single MotoGP event happening one week later had a direct impact of 40 million euros, according to Camilo Lourenço, a Portuguese journalist and broadcaster.
This shows what many of us already understood after the first Portuguese Websummit edition. Although it is huge from a Portuguese standpoint, it isn’t a significant event in the tech industry. If you want to sample some empirical evidence, try to search for Websummit related news that doesn’t have a Portuguese origin. From Spain, the Czech Republic and the Netherlands, it is near zilch. I took the time of searching via an Irish connection, and there I got a few hits, but not from the good kind. Many articles denounce a suit filed by Websummit against a former partner for breaching fiduciary duty. The same ex-partner sued back for different reasons, but the spat made many digital news shops. &lt;a href=&quot;https://econews.pt/2021/11/12/web-summit-in-shock-with-ex-partner-which-it-accuses-of-diverting-attention-with-new-lawsuit/&quot;&gt;The situation was also echoed here in Portugal by ECO&lt;/a&gt; some days ago.
While reviewing this piece, there’s another development. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/paddycosgrave/status/1459881354448056320&quot;&gt;Mr Paddy Cosgrave issued a public threat on Twitter against the press that echoes the subject&lt;/a&gt;. This isn’t something that we should read from someone that organizes an event where the free press is lauded.
Legal issues apart, one can’t say that the event is a scam. It impacts the local tech scene and correlates well with the hiring uptick from many known companies that settled in Portugal, but it isn’t the wealth driver that so many punters, some of them active politicians, repeat in every local news media.
It’s also expensive. One general attendee ticket in 2019 went from 450 euro up to 850 euro. For reference, the minimum wage in Portugal is 740.83 euros. If you’re from abroad, add up lodging and food expenses on top, which is a steep investment, or bet, for many. Unless you’re pitching, investing, building or exploring a network connection, or simply hustling inside, I won’t recommend the setback, especially if you’re living from Portuguese wages.
Websummit people understand well that it is hard to make an event if you don’t have a crowd. I believe that so many of us got free or heavily discounted tickets just to put some boots on the ground. Celebrity guests like Al Gore, Tony Blair, Evan Williams, Mark Schneider, Stephen Hawking, and many more bring many visitors and build attendances, but it isn’t enough in a “thin cow season”.
Nonetheless, if you’re paying taxes in Portugal, you’re paying a part of Websummit since the Portuguese government splurges 11 million euros per event every year. When I say every year, it even includes last year, with the event running online only. Good grief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, repeating my mantra,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;” This is the last Websummit that I’ll visit while an ‘attendee’ “.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        	&lt;p&gt;A few minutes before writing this summary, I got the email warning from WebSummit with the title “Opening Night kicks off soon.”. The clock counter states four hours and a few minutes until the event opens doors.
As I’ve mentioned in our previous instalment, these mega-events mark the beginning of an “after Covid” era, and in Portugal, they make even more sense considering economic and social factors.
And, with this social behaviour change, I’m also going to make some changes in our MV Journal format! Considering my availability for this project, these developments will come slowly, and they will start this week with a minor tweak. From now on, the first section, 0, will stay fixed under “News.ceil”. 
First, did you get the title trick? If you’re a programmer, I hope you do :).
Second, “News.ceil” will contain an assortment of the most impactful news of the last couple of weeks, some oddities and those little gems from the hidden corners of the interwebs. Without any in-depth analysis but pointing to the best sources for the topics in the webverse, you’ll get a tasty slice of the last fifteen days of tech-related news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#newsceil&quot;&gt;News.ceil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#meta&quot;&gt;Meta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;newsceil&quot;&gt;News.ceil&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple Events! You got to love them. So over the top, but that is what you should expect from Giga Brands such as this one.
Within the announcement myriad, Apple stays strong with the strategy of controlling silicon and software pushing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22726444/apple-m1-pro-max-chip-processor-arm-macbook-fastest&quot;&gt;brand new M1 machines&lt;/a&gt; to the market. I’ve discouraged many developers from buying the first iteration but now….oh boy. It seems that nothing can beat the performance of Apple Silicon chips, so grab them while they’re hot. In terms of machine design, let’s praise who decided to kill the touch bar and bring back missed ports!
One rant, though. Why &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22734676/apple-macbook-pro-notch-botch-face-id-missing-feature-design&quot;&gt;the camera notch Apple&lt;/a&gt;? Why? I’ll file this as a design failure for now, and let’s kill this on the next iteration, ok?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gaming industry is also bubbling here and there. Christmas is one of those seasons where revenue metrics dictate the success of many shops, but for BigGame, such as EA, it’s just another iteration of some cash cows,   a few experiments going bust and some acquisitions that start to pay off. Nonetheless &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/rip-fifa-ea-trademarks-ea-sports-fc/&quot;&gt;EA is tired of paying FIFA for their brand and called it quits&lt;/a&gt;. This is a bold move since gamers like to play with their favourite sports stars and not name gimmicks. Kids want to control Messi and Ronaldo, not Messiah or Reinaldo. Let’s see who gets the next FIFA partnership, but FIFA 22 will mark the end of an era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LinkedIn is still one of the most important platforms for tech hiring globally, but it seems that the brand was getting stuck rolling out new verticals and understanding the market of tech contractors that keeps growing every day. Finally, they took the hint, and last week, &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/linkedin-rolls-out-its-freelance-services-marketplace-globally-after-picking-up-2m-users-in-smaller-us-beta&quot;&gt;they launched a platform for freelancers with a small 2 million user beta in the united states&lt;/a&gt;. For some, this looks like it is too late, but we shouldn’t dismiss the weight of LinkedIn’s brand and the deep pockets of Microsoft. Yes, LinkedIn was bought by Microsoft some years ago. Did you notice it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, in the tech business world, Mr Mark Zuccerberg unveiled &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;Meta&lt;/a&gt; but for this one, just follow the link to my piece for a good read :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the developer world, we also got some exciting news. Following the trend of remote interface development environments or just IDEs, &lt;a href=&quot;https://directionwithintent.com/mvjournal/mvjournal_13/#the-resource-balance-loop---remote-development-ides-are-back-again&quot;&gt;that we’ve explored in a previous issue&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2021/10/20/vscode-dev&quot;&gt;Microsoft released a version of Visual Studio completely web-based&lt;/a&gt;. I still didn’t have any time for a quick test drive, but considering the official announcement, it seems that the editor is still for lightweight code changes and not as a fully-fledged editor. Nothing new then, and I’m still sceptical regarding the web-based IDE. Maybe for Engineering Managers or QA teams to inspect code and quickly add a few notes or minor corrections? Let’s see how this trend pans out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intel is again on the news, but this time for open-source software. &lt;a href=&quot;https://venturebeat.com/2021/10/20/intel-open-sources-ai-powered-tool-to-spots-bugs-in-code/&quot;&gt;They released an AI-powered bug catching tool&lt;/a&gt;. This is the type of “Copilot” that I want to support my development efforts. I don’t wish that my IDE tries to auto-complete my code. Maybe some boilerplate structure, but that is it. Now, in terms of automatically generating tests and catching bugs, bring those AI overlords, please.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to end this first instalment of News.ceill - you did get the name, right? - Mr Jonh Carmack, Consulting CTO at Oculus VR and nerd god, launched a patch for Oculus Go owners that allow low-level access to the device operating system. Hack away said God when discontinuing an older machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I hope you’ve enjoyed this first News.ceil. If you still have time and patience, take a look at Meta. For me, it’s an inevitable future. For many, it’s hell on earth. &lt;a href=&quot;https://fortune.com/2021/10/29/john-carmack-facebook-oculus-metaverse-mark-zuckerberg/&quot;&gt;For Mr Jonh Carmack, it is a mistake&lt;/a&gt;. And you? #TeamMeta or #TeamGetMeOutOfHere?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;Meta&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;october-31th&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;October 31th&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hiro Protagonist might be one of the best names ever for a fiction story protagonist, and probably for one of the most relevant Cyberpunk books in the genre, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Crash&quot;&gt;Snow Crash&lt;/a&gt; from Mr &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_Stephenson&quot;&gt;Neal Stephenson&lt;/a&gt;.
If you’re not tuned up with this story, Hiro is a Mafia pizza delivery man and a world-renowned hacker that partakes in the widespread Metaverse - please ALWAYS read Metaverse with an ominous tone for entertainment purposes.
The Metaverse, in the context of Snow Crash, was a virtual medium that connected all the existing virtual worlds, converging them with physical reality. Owned by a single company in terms of virtual real estate, it is the space where mere mortals become whatever they want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you see some similarities with some recent news, take a look at the following paragraph first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2003, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linden_Lab&quot;&gt;Linden Lab&lt;/a&gt; launched Second Life, a metaverse for your virtual presence, and it still runs today with between half and one million monthly regular users depending on who’s counting.
Second Life took the web by storm has many other virtual worlds after it but with the difference that it wasn’t a game. Within the hardware and software technological limitations, it was the promised virtual open world for everyone to be whatever they wanted. Users could build infrastructure and engage in business using an official currency, and until today the system tries to replicate every activity that a human can do in the real world.
Many celebrities accepted invitations to participate in events, politicians made speeches, and even the International Space Station, or ISS, got a replica for space explorers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.secondlife.com/p/International-Space-Station/8451946&quot;&gt;Nowadays, you can buy one for yourself&lt;/a&gt;, but Second Life is a virtual world separated from our physical reality. The single point of contact was probably the Linden Dolar that eventually was used as a pseudo digital currency in many domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;October 2021, Facebook becomes Meta. We saw a similar move from Google a few years ago when they became Alphabet. Of course, Google and Facebook still exist, but both businesses created a higher entity to envelop all their parts under one corporate name. You can still search on Google, and your social media app will still hold the name Facebook. Nonetheless, there is a significant difference between Alphabet and Meta. While Alphabet was an organizational move, Meta is an objective itself, one that you’ve probably already got a hold of, whether from my previous paragraphs or from the news webstream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meta, &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/facebook-company-is-now-meta/&quot;&gt;as presented by Mr Mark Zuckerberg&lt;/a&gt;, will be - yet another - Metaverse, but one much more ambitious in its reach, one that follows more closely Mr Neal Stephenson’s Metaverse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;keynote-impressions&quot;&gt;Keynote Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Zuckerberg Meta’s determined vision - the Metaverse - where physical remoteness should not be a barrier for doing anything that you can do with your friends like they were right beside you, although far from reach.
In the keynote’s first minutes, we are introduced to a world similar to another science fiction writer that got a movie as well recently. Mr Ernest Cline’s Ready Player One depicts a virtual world that matches Mr Zuckerberg’s expectations for his Metaverse. Your virtual self can be whatever you want to be, and you can jump between your local virtual room and augmented physical reality with the flick of your virtual wrist controller.
While the vision is grand, the words from the keynote are conservative and careful, pointing out that we are still years from the objective and no one knows how many.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The iterative story starts at Horizon Home, a closed space simulacrum of your ideal home, where you can exist and interact with the environment while inviting friends for shared experiences. You can jump to many other virtual spaces creating an illusion of limitless open-world experiences. The previous ensemble of activities comprises Horizon Worlds, where the Metaverse starts to expand.
Jumping from your couch directly to a concert probably will not happen that soon, and if it happens, I have serious doubts that your interaction with the live event will be meaningful and satisfying. Consumers’ bland experience will be punished early when the vision boasts an almost realistic interaction with your friends in the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;crypto&quot;&gt;Crypto?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the big announcements was subtly added as a minor side effect of such a world. The NFT auction at an after-party should make politicians in the modern world shudder. If you didn’t feel the force disturbance when an inconspicuous transaction happens during the presentation, you’re still outside the crypto bubble.
After each presentation segment, we need to recentre our expectations, adding a solid pinch of salt on what we’ve seen, but the simple exchange of something unseen with an avatar getting instantly dressed in an NFT auctioned jacket is that kind of utopia served upon a dystopian plate. For someone that knows and may have used Second Life Metaverse, Linden dollars solved the problem, but the current technology space points into a pseudo decentralized system around blockchains.
The “NFT” abbreviation isn’t innocent for sure and especially when no explanation of its meaning was added to the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later in the keynote, we get to see a Mr Vishal Shah, Metaverse’s VP presenting the business possibilities to Ms Jackie Aina, owner of FORVR, or Forever Mood, a beauty and wellness brand targetted at black women.
There is much opportunity to make money from pulling fans to your Horizon home and having unique virtual pop-up sales that mix digital experiences and assets with physical products. Extending actual products to a virtual environment, enhancing them with augmented reality experiences that can be shared with your friends at your home, whether a Horizon home or your physical home, will reinforce the notion of continuity between environments.
But again, the “NFT” reference is reinforced at this point.
Cryptocurrencies are already here, and for the last decade, have been touted as the future of money. The reality is that they are unfeasible as a day to day transaction token, and to become that unseen medium of exchange in the keynote, centralization is needed. I’ll leave it to your imagination who will be the cluster of centralized hosts managing the Metaverse currency that also extends to our meatspace reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;gaming&quot;&gt;Gaming&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gaming wasn’t forgotten, and how could it be when so many of us got to experience RPGs Metaverses such as World of Warcraft and Runescape?
It’s probably the stepping stone for many that still aren’t digital children at this point in time. Games are a great way of practising virtual social interaction with peers and will be the single thing to do in the Metaverse for many for a while. We are already seeing some virtual gaming events amassing participant numbers that compete with any sports events.
Fortnite counted up to 15.3 million users in the last live event &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/1235632/fortnite-biggest-live-events/&quot;&gt;but the number wasn’t very far from previous ones&lt;/a&gt;
Time to start building your Metaverse gaming rigs?
Probably not because it seems that everything will be supported by Quest’s systems, the latest Oculus headsets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evolution from standing still VR gaming to a workout activity is almost natural. Exploring worlds in a 3D setting almost implies some body movement to reach, inspect, interact and eventually attack your adversaries. Nevertheless, this is still in the realm of gaming experiences that we might find in any gaming console or personal computer. The transition to games that required fitness is almost trivial, and we already have a few examples from Nintendo Wii well before Quest fitness apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;remotish-work&quot;&gt;Remotish Work&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working remotely was forced upon many offices worldwide with the Covid-19 pandemic, which probably helped build and test existing Quest workplace features.
Remote settings are here to stay, and assuming that we will go back to the old ways is naif, to say the least. Meta’s features for the workplace will be at the forefront of the project, and while it isn’t apparent for many, this is a requirement for a successful Metaverse. We’ve felt the impersonal world of a remote work environment, mixing video group calls with messaging, and we know it will not satisfy our social needs, but we’ve also seen the benefits of living happily with our partners and avoiding commute time that we don’t know how we can live with it again. We’ve understood that location will matter less and less with technology evolving over time. Working through the Metaverse is inescapable, considering our environmental concerns as well, so when do you think your work will only exist through the Metaverse?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about learning? Very similar to working, but I don’t date to venture into early ages. I can’t see kids not having virtual environments in formative years, especially when real life will be a mix of virtual with real. Learning what can harm and what can be fun is part of building the self. It should be the same but with an extra technology layer that transforms any human into a super-powered Metaverse user.
For adults, well, how about that MBA to push your career to the next level? Just teleport to your University and don’t forget to study hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3darvr-content&quot;&gt;3D/AR/VR Content&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Content creation is a significant entry barrier, but creating and hosting a website was also a task for technical experts twenty years ago. Nowadays, anyone can quickly create an internet presence with many services and tools for affordable prices in economically developed countries. Meta’s learned with the past shows that they are investing hard into ways for content creators to craft augmented realities and distinct elements that can differentiate their environment from the pack. Providing easy to use tools to creators is one of the most essential pillars for the fast scaling of the Metaverse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-gear&quot;&gt;The gear&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology and hardware evolution jumps are required if the Metaverse is something appealing for the mass market. &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;I’ve already covered the evolution and contenders in the augmented reality space&lt;/a&gt; in RayBan Storie’s piece.
One of the stated objectives for Rayban Stories is to normalize augmented reality behaviour in an open world, and for that, we don’t really require the final technology. Interaction with a “smart glass” device will be a step forward into more rich and complex experiences like the ones that Snap presented with their latest product.
Mr Zuckerberg also explored some investigation streams, lifting the curtain of experimental products and pure research exercises that look impressive and promise much but unfortunately are still years ahead of us. Nevertheless, this part of the keynote sneak peeks at the investment made into the devices that will allow us to partake in the Metaverse. Meta already has deep pockets, but I guess that the required funds will bring new venture capital money to the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;and-you&quot;&gt;And you?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For us, son’s of the digital age, the Metaverse looks like something that will happen no matter who builds it and how it is built. With so many technologies and services popping up from the innovator’s slipstream, we can feel it right around the corner, emerging from a chaotic process. Some bits and pieces of existing technology can be coupled together to create a Metaverse gimmick, but we know that the trick is just entertainment for a short period.
Meta is the first company to explicitly make a Metaverse its own challenge and final objective while humbly assuming that there is much to be built, skipping the stupidity of a deadline in such a project.
Just like Tesla’s autopilot seems attainable this decade, I’m also rooting for the same regarding the Metaverse and ready for my Oculus Quest Teleport headgear. The fun part? You don’t have to choose between a red or a blue pill. You can have them both. Are you in?&lt;/p&gt;

        	&lt;img src=&quot;https://directionwithintent.com/images/Banner_MVJournal_banner_16.png&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        	&lt;p&gt;Did you survive the great social blackout event on the 4th?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too dramatic?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess since Twitter and LinkedIn kept humming with the extra pressure from Instagram influencers looking for Twitter Fleets and Facebook rant posts that had to be “threaded”.
The most significant impact that I’ve felt was on messaging since I rely too much on Facebook Messenger and Whatsapp. &lt;a href=&quot;https://it.slashdot.org/story/21/10/05/2110251/telegram-founder-says-over-70-million-new-users-joined-during-facebook-outage&quot;&gt;Telegram also took the surge hit with many subscribing for its free services&lt;/a&gt; I have a Telegram account, but most of the time, I’m idle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook went down for one round taking many services with it. My first bet was related to some Cloudflare issue or AWS ruining the party in some major region, and I was naif, of course. The problem is “always” the same, and if by any chance you’ve been sequestered under a rock, I’ll explain it in our last article. Just remember that this happened one day before &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/windows-11-all-best-features-in-microsofts-new-os-and-how-to-use-them/&quot;&gt;Windows 11 was unleashed&lt;/a&gt;, and I know many that bet on that horse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Twitch, the streaming service owned by Amazon, forcibly went open-source but let’s not talk much about it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22714160/twitch-hack-security-data-breach-problems&quot;&gt;check this link instead&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, some weeks ago, &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2021/cloudflares-disruption/&quot;&gt;Cloudflare launched R2&lt;/a&gt;, a cloud object storage stepping lightly on AWS S3 toes. Finally, an excellent alternative to avoid the Amazon file storage monopoly. It still misses many integrations and features to compete head-to-head with AWS, but it’s nice to see emboldened contenders getting into a dark red ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#landing-at-futureworks&quot;&gt;Landing at Future.Works&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#netsplit&quot;&gt;Netsplit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;landing-at-futureworks&quot;&gt;Landing at Future.Works&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;october-16&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;October 16&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m writing this first paragraph right before Jonh Romero enters &lt;a href=&quot;https://future.works/tech-conference/&quot;&gt;“Future.Works”&lt;/a&gt; main stage to play “a few” Doom deathmatches.
At the forefront of the COVID-19 vaccination drive, Portugal is gently opening up with some courageous in-person events. Courageous, not because we are still facing a pandemic but because we are starting our everyday lives while the former it’s weaning down. Investing in events at this time is a risky business that many still avoid at all costs. With the two standard Pfizer jabs, even yours truly is still guessing when to restart in-person AWS User Group Meetups in Lisbon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;

    &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“So, was it worth it?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-1&quot;&gt;Day 1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday, I was able to get to the event near 18 right after leaving the office. With doors closing at 21:30, there was ample time to, at least, sample all booths and select a few for the next day while visiting one or two conference sessions.
Well, it took 30 minutes to see it all. A small corridor of stands comprising more or less a 500-meter length at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://lisbonvenues.pt/en/lisbon-congress-center/&quot;&gt;Lisbon Congress Centre&lt;/a&gt; was enough to host less than twenty companies.
It felt underwhelming from someone who had the chance of being present at some of “Landing.Jobs Festival” events, the previous version of the tech conference/job fair. Most of the companies are actively recruiting online, and if you’re from the tech industry and an active participant on LinkedIn, there was almost nothing new to see.
Lisbon is small, and after one lap around the event area, it was enough to bump with many known faces and exchange impressions with visitors.
The feeling of emptiness was common, but even with such a limited scope, everyone was happy to visit and meet company representatives in person while networking with fellow attendees. COVID-19 etiquette for greetings? What a mess.
Still, I was happy to meet &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tecracer.de/&quot;&gt;tecRacer&lt;/a&gt;’s team. They are a german AWS shop planning a new office to scale up their business in Europe. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcobrunner/&quot;&gt;Marco Brunner&lt;/a&gt; is tecRacer’s team lead at their Munich’s office. With a personal connection to Portugal, he was optimistic about their hiring efforts, although they didn’t close any contract at the time.
With so many good conversations here and there mixed with free beer, time flew and eventually, I’ve lost all conference sessions. It felt good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-2&quot;&gt;Day 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arriving a bit sooner since the doors should be closing at 18:30, I did not see a significant attendee count difference even considering it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Romero&quot;&gt;Jonh Romero’s&lt;/a&gt; day.
Probably many were there just for the chance of seeing and interacting with the living legend and not really to find a job. Event managers everywhere can relate, and a generous budget that gets you a VIP like Jonh Romero might make the difference in such events’ success. WebSummit people know that very well.
Before Jonh Romero’s deathmatches, I was able to talk for a few minutes with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrericardoladeira/&quot;&gt;André Ladeira&lt;/a&gt;, a business developer for “Landing.jobs” job recruiting platform. Many companies refused his advances while showing availability for remote environments. Without disclosing any booth prices, he pointed out that COVID-19 was a significant deterrent for any sponsorship, even when we see businesses fighting daily battles to retain and recruit IT specialists in many areas.
With not much to do until the final event, before a few lucky ones head into the traditional boat after-parties, I engaged with a few companies on the floor. Enthusiasm was going down but not for tecRacer. They’ve managed to close three hires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;deathmatch&quot;&gt;Deathmatch&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main stage had many seats available. Right before the photo below, Jonh Romero had a small queue outside waiting for autographs and pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://directionwithintent.com/images/jonhready.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From an old-timer like me, it felt a bit sad but also a privilege. With few people at the end of the event, attendees had more time and a chance to exchange a few words with Doom’s creator.
Eight nervous players went to the stage and got a lesson from the master. Miguel, an attendee in the front row by my side, was one of the winners of Day 1 deathmatches which granted him a session with Jonh. I’ve asked him how many kills he was expecting to get. “One would be a victory”, he said. He got three against twenty from Jonh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-was-it-worth-it&quot;&gt;So, was it worth it?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For someone that benefited from a fully discounted ticket, it was.
It was good to see people coming together again and a company like “Landing.jobs” taking the plunge to lead in-person tech events again. For the last two years, many of us got used to remote settings with streaming sessions happening globally. Going back to what we call “normal life” will take energy and time, and we need more events like this one to ignite our hearts and minds. After this, I’m going to help a bit and restart in-person AWS User Groups again. Even if we are few, it is time to do it again.
So, a big thanks to “Landing.jobs” to make this happen against the social grain. A few weeks from now, we’ll have WebSummit. Will I see you there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://directionwithintent.com/images/end.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;netsplit&quot;&gt;Netsplit.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;september-28&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;September 28&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat&quot;&gt;Internet Relay Chat&lt;/a&gt;, or just IRC, was a popular message exchange system until the first decade of this millennium. The lightweight protocol, implemented by mIRC, an application for users to participate in IRC server groups,  allowed parties to interact privately or publicly amongst themselves.
For simplicity, an IRC network was an ensemble of chat servers that participated in the network. A user used mIRC or other compatible applications to connect to one of those servers and gain access to an IRC network.
As you might imagine, most of the connectivity wasn’t high-quality fibre back in the day, and it was usual for some servers to fall out of a distributed network while working for local users. We called it a Netsplit. The phenomenon was evident when it happened. Connected users would see in their client interfaces an announcement barrage of user disconnection messages in public channels that would be replaced by another wall of connections coming in when the network connection was reestablished. Sometimes the Netsplit was only the result of an IRC Cop, an IRC server administrator, disconnecting from the network explicitly for some executive reason. The Facebook outage of October 4th was their own version of a netsplit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It happens to everyone, and it will happen again eventually. Internet services outages have many root causes. Usually, they stem from day to day human intervention errors and rarely from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/lightning-strike-zaps-ec2-ireland/&quot;&gt;a lightning strike&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=&quot;https://directionwithintent.com/mvjournal/mvjournal_2/#ovh-roof-was-on-fire-and-we-dodged-that-bullet&quot;&gt;spontaneus combustion&lt;/a&gt; of a datacentre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We still have a fairly distributed network for our Internet needs, and a service outage is often local whether we are talking about a service single-point of failure or availability disparities for clusters of users. Some people can see and interact with a service, but some others can’t. Some services are down, some others still work without any problems (another finish term here).
While our Internet infrastructure can withstand some disorganization and partial failures, services will fail if they don’t take advantage of those features. When a company or service becomes a significant part of the Internet and concentrates all network elements and core services in a single place or network to avoid that inherent distribution instability, a misconfiguration might be enough for all hell to break loose.
“It’s always DNS” was probably the most repeated sentence that day by the SysAdmin community worldwide, and it was but not in the usual sense.  The Facebook outage was partially a combination of misconfiguration associated with an internal tool bug that took down the backbone &lt;a href=&quot;https://engineering.fb.com/2021/10/05/networking-traffic/outage-details/&quot;&gt;as explained in their own words&lt;/a&gt;. One of the side effects was the isolation of their centralized DNS infrastructure from the rest of the world, causing a netsplit of every network or datacentre connected to the backbone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;spooky-action-at-a-distance&quot;&gt;Spooky action at a distance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Einstein famous words “Spooky action at a distance” tried to convey the non-local effects of a quantum measurement. For simplicity sake, if you get a particle measurement in one location, you can instantly know the state of an entangled particle miles away. Facebook absorbed many companies while growing up into the behemoth that we know nowadays. We can count Instagram and Whatsapp within the roster of acquisitions, so the outage extended to those services since they are entangled in the same Facebook network universe. Your writer produced the following meme when WhatsApp returned a plain 500 internal server error:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://directionwithintent.com/images/meme.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, there are also different types of secondary internet entanglements that we can see in the extended Internet universe. Due to Facebook size, DNS request failures &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/during-the-facebook-outage/&quot;&gt;cascaded to other services as was seen by Cloudflare&lt;/a&gt; impacting other prominent players.
So if you observe instability on a brand so large as Facebook, you’ll have a correlated negative effect on the remainder network entangled participants but a positive if you are a competitor.
Faced with an unresponding service, Internet users turned to other messaging applications such as Telegram and Signal, creating a surge of new signups or inactive accounts becoming active. Within the “social” environment, TikTok and Snap already have their own user universes that share or steal accounts from Facebook services, so users that want to keep consuming content took their attention to traditional sources, newspapers and “internet portals” such as Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;funny-aspects&quot;&gt;“Funny” aspects&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somewhere in the 80s, the sentence “eat your own dog food” gained traction within the software industry after a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food#:~:text=In%201988%2C%20Microsoft%20manager%20Paul,term%20spread%20through%20the%20company.&quot;&gt;famous Microsoft internal email&lt;/a&gt;. The idea was to incentivize the use of your own company products and services internally instead. While the principle behind it was in the right place, relying too much on a centralized set of services might become an issue, especially if you don’t manage your disaster recovery plans well.
Facebook felt this dearly when access to company buildings got affected, but their badge control systems. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-employees-no-access-conference-rooms-because-of-outage-2021-10&quot;&gt;Many employees weren’t allowed to enter buildings for several hours during the outage&lt;/a&gt; until physical security processes were deployed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tech.slashdot.org/story/21/10/05/2152210/oculus-quest-becomes-a-paperweight-when-facebook-goes-down&quot;&gt;Oculus Quest, Facebook’s virtual reality headset, was also affected&lt;/a&gt;. Users reported that they couldn’t use the device to access their libraries since the product requires a Facebook login to use it if you didn’t buy the expensive version that relieves you from that social burden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At last, and still related with the “dogfooding” within Facebook services, messaging got affected as you know already. Teams were unable to communicate and orchestrate properly since every channel was down.
How do they solve it asks the attentive reader?
Although there isn’t reliable information about their internal procedures, the rumour is that they went back to a system that works perfectly in such situations, IRC.&lt;/p&gt;

        	&lt;img src=&quot;https://directionwithintent.com/images/Banner_MVJournal_banner_15.png&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        	&lt;p&gt;After a few MV Journals, I’m finding out that I fall very quickly for stories about technologies with a few decades of history. The fun part is learning that they are even older than I’ve had thought and the impact that they already had in the current iterations.
This edition will explore two brand new devices, still in early access, that might shape how we will interact with things that keep getting more “smart” and intrusive in our lives while relieving burdens or just helping an ordinary mortal to interact with the Metaverse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#the-robots-are-returning&quot;&gt;The Robots are returning!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#mirrorshades&quot;&gt;Mirrorshades&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-robots-are-returning&quot;&gt;The Robots are returning!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;september-28&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;September 28&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj1t3msy8dc&quot;&gt;Amazon Astro’s promotional video&lt;/a&gt; popped up on my social stream without much fanfare, making me very curious about the gadget. Devices like this usually get more attention from the media, but after digging a bit, I’ve found that I’ve missed Amazon’s Devices event where Astro was announced. The event propped up many exciting goodies, including new versions for existing devices and a stronger integration bond between services and devices for the household. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22692147/amazon-devices-event-echo-ring-biggest-announcements&quot;&gt;Take a peek at the list&lt;/a&gt; but put your credit card far from reach.
Christmas is right around the corner, and you should expect some fresh gimmicks to hit the market, begging for those pandemic saved moneys. Even with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020%E2%80%932021_global_chip_shortage&quot;&gt;chip shortage&lt;/a&gt; stalling many carmakers, there’s still some space for refreshing low-end tech and appease hungry consumers.
Yes, I’m priming you for disappointment, but there are buts, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;robota&quot;&gt;Robota&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not a fun word for sure. “Robota” stands for “forced labour” in Slavic. A word for feudal times, repurposed by Mr Karel Čapek and Mr Josef Čapek to depict an artificial human worker without a soul. Even today, the term fits perfectly. Robots might be fun, but we are still creating many to do things that we don’t or can’t do, so I guess that slave automata will eventually become widespread before global warming hits the fan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exploring Robots, in general, is a worthy book topic that goes well beyond this piece, but I would like to trace back a few of the gimmicks that we’ve seen in the last half a century while presenting a few that are very successful within a household.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;house-tamed-robots&quot;&gt;House Tamed Robots&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to search for the name of the first one that I can remember from my childhood. We saw its exhibitions in TV shows, some quite disturbing, like when a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od24yglAYUg&quot;&gt;Portuguese TV series from the 90s made it a character for an episode&lt;/a&gt;, but I think most of my memories are Disney cartoon books’ advertising. Tomy’s Omnibot 2000 is a blast from the past. A remote-controlled robot that could carry a drink, play &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassette_tape&quot;&gt;cassettes&lt;/a&gt; (notice the link on this ancient word since there’s a big chance of being an arcane term if you’re born in this millennia ), wake you up with its alarm clock and do a few other extra tricks.
The Omnibot 2000 was the product of the Japanese tech boom and probably the most advanced one in the Tommy Robot series, which included simpler and more affordable toys. The Omnibot got into the market in 1983 and made a decade of success at least. Before this magic millennium of same-day shipping, novelties took a while to get into Europe, so it wasn’t unusual to see such a device hit Christmas shelves in the 90s only after it became boring in the United States of America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the Omnibot was a state of the art gadget at the time, it was still a robot gimmick and an expensive one, setting you back by 600 dollars. Adjusting the value for inflation using &lt;a href=&quot;https://smartasset.com/investing/inflation-calculator#xDiEzLDifu&quot;&gt;Smart Asset Inflation calculator&lt;/a&gt; places the Omnibot in the 1,600 dollars vicinity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Omnibot’s success, more came and failed to deliver anything helpful in the coming decades, but from time to time, one or another would make the news bouts and sell some units while the novelty halo lasted. Within the roster of mildly successful bots, we can find &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;Aibo from Sony&lt;/a&gt;, first launched in 1999, the bot mimicking a dog is &lt;a href=&quot;https://electronics.sony.com/c/aibo&quot;&gt;still on sale nowadays with a 3K price tag&lt;/a&gt;. More recently, we also had Sphero and its reincarnation in the Star Wars universe as BB-8. With few features, it is still a fun bot to play for a while, but the Sphero series has many options for kids exploring their way into Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics fields or just STEM as the set is summarized nowadays. &lt;a href=&quot;https://sphero.com/&quot;&gt;Sphero’s store&lt;/a&gt; sells many parts that will allow our bright kids to build fun and entertaining toys while learning essential skills for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;herobots&quot;&gt;Herobots&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look around and check how many truly useful robots are doing anything around you. Not many, sure, since most do their work in the background, and you’ll probably never know most of them, but a few became household heroes, saving the tired middle-class time and money. From a not so extensive list, I’ve selected two that became valuable magical helpers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;roomba&quot;&gt;Roomba&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll start with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.irobot.com/&quot;&gt;iRobot’s&lt;/a&gt; Roomba since I own one and can definitely see the device’s benefit. &lt;a href=&quot;https://media.irobot.com/2002-09-18-iRobot-Introduces-Roomba-Intelligent-FloorVac-The-First-Automatic-Floor-Cleaner-In-The-U-S#:~:text=The%20product's%20%24199.95%20(SRP)%20price,market%2C%20September%2018%2C%202002.&quot;&gt;Roomba’s debut in 2002&lt;/a&gt; was well received by the public, especially with a price tag of 199.95 dollars which is well within reach of a large consumer base. The not so smart bot was smart enough to vacuum large surfaces and deal with the usual obstacles at home. Unfortunately, the bot doesn’t handle stairs, and it uses a system of virtual walls, a beacon that emits signals to ward off Roomba from prohibited or dangerous areas. But even this Roomba Achilles heel doesn’t diminish much the value that the bot delivers. Even the older versions that don’t map house surroundings or have a remote-controlled mobile App are enough to keep your grounds tidy. Just program the sweeping days and hours, connect its base station in any socket and leave it be. Nowadays, iRobot’s roster goes beyond the simple task of vacuuming floors and provides solutions for pools, broad glass surfaces and floor washing bots. It’s not hard to imagine many bots such as the Roomba scurrying around households and keeping your living environment well disinfected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;thermomix&quot;&gt;Thermomix&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might not call it a robot, but the thing doesn’t have to wander around your house to be one. Kitchen robots usually stay put in your food preparation areas, excluding some mixing accidents that happen here and there and might make them move a bit more than they should, but in normal circumstances, one expects good service for confection menial tasks.
Thermomix, or Bimby in some countries, has a huge fan base. The product door-to-door sales vector is unusual today, but relying on travelling salesmen was widespread back in the day. Nowadays, you can buy one online in some countries, but the sales process still uses word of mouth with practical demonstrations from certified sales representatives.
Although I cannot vouch for Thermomix’s remarkable features, I failed to meet a single owner that doesn’t praise the robot for saving meal preparation times and helping find affordable healthy options with simple ingredients. Recent versions even connect to the internet to access a plethora of official and community recipes, from baby food to deserts. But this robot isn’t at the reach of any pocket. With a price tag a bit below 1300 euros for the Bimby model, it is a hard sell to the cash strapped middle class. Looking around online, you might find some old used models. If you ask the current owner why they are selling, the most common response is, “I want to buy the new version.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;amazon-astro&quot;&gt;Amazon Astro&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, the Amazon Astro. We didn’t even scratch the surface of the Robot “eco” system, and I’m not sure I would be up to the task, but the brief overview of the last decades of bots shows that few are actually helpful and productive.
Amazon touts Astro as a companion Robot with home surveillance features. While I believe in the “surveillance” part since it’s equipped with Alexa and a trial for Amazon Ring Pro service, it is still hard to see it as a companion bot, but the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078NSDFSB&quot;&gt;official spec&lt;/a&gt; states that it can help the elderly with some simple alerts.
The promotional video shows the sleek bot waking up after being alerted to noise and catching a racoon with its paws deep in the cake jar. The use case is far fetched for sure, but the idea of having some device watching your home with an integrated alarm is definitely appealing for many, myself included. Cameras with motion detection can even be found at your local supermarket, but I don’t know a single one that can roam around the house and peek into hard places. Add some remote control capabilities, and you’ll have your personal home spy bot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;service-required&quot;&gt;Service Required&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes me a bit weary is the Ring Pro features that I can’t understand why the device requires a service subscription to have local autonomous behaviours. Take, for instance, patrols and event-triggered investigations. Why does a Robot need a service connection to execute tasks that don’t require external computation or storage?
Add Alexa Guard, an Amazon service that uses Echo or Echo Show for a home security helpline. Combining Guard with Astro and Ring allows for hands-free emergency helpline calls. Again, why do I need a subscription for executing a simple call when you’re already paying for Guard Plus?
I hope we can escape this service hell that companies are building around devices and features that don’t require upgrades to keep doing what they already do right out of the factory. Checking the list of features that require a service subscription for such a device made me recall Netflix’s Love Death and Robots short animation, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9lTsnlJXcw&quot;&gt;“Automated Customer Service”&lt;/a&gt;. No. Please no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-1&quot;&gt;Day 1&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick visit to Amazon’s Astro page will show the label “Day 1 Edition”. If you don’t know what it means, it is easy to explain. Although the device is production-ready, it is still in a preview phase where Amazon discounts the price and only sells to approved buyers. You’ll have to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22698401/amazon-astro-invite-preorder-how-to-info-early-access-price&quot;&gt;fill in an invite request&lt;/a&gt; before having the privilege of being relieved of 999.99 dollars. Astro has many limitations, and Amazon acknowledges them. They’ll probably avoid clients with tricky environments where the bot will not work correctly. Do you have a glossy black floor or transitions with reliefs above 3.5 cms? You’ll have to wait for the next version if it comes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-future&quot;&gt;The future&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An increased price tag for starters. The discounted price of 999.99 dollars will climb up to 1,449.99 if everything goes well with this version. There is also potential for more features, of course, and from my point of view, some modularity would help to get a more extensive consumer base. Adding a vacuum module or replacing the fixed pole camera with a [Ring Always Home] optional camera would make the device much more appealing. And if one of the proposals is that Astro works as a company bot, why not add a “Hey Disney” virtual assistant to keep kids entertained while your Bimby works out the dinner?
I’m sure that I will want a few years from now, but I’ll wait for the intrepid early adopters to smooth out the kinks with such a steep price tag.
Oh, and by the way, Amazon’s Astro has the following warning on their page:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*We want you to know Astro cannot go up or down stairs.*&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…and it doesn’t vacuum anything. Unimpressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;mirrorshades&quot;&gt;Mirrorshades&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;september-13&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;September 13&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On September 9th, Thursday morning, Mr Mark Zuckerberg announced Ray-Ban Stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://directionwithintent.com/images/maxresdefault.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right at the beginning of the video, Mr Mark states something that resonates with every science fiction connoisseur:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“…and you don’t have to choose between interacting with a device or interacting with the world around you.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between the 60s and 70s, a new genre emerged from the literary masterpieces penned by Mr &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_K._Dick&quot;&gt;Philip K. Dick&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Ellison&quot;&gt;Harlan Ellison&lt;/a&gt;, Ms &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursula_K._Le_Guin&quot;&gt;Ursula K. Le Guin&lt;/a&gt;, and so many others that I feel ashamed for not providing the complete Hero list. A few years before these Heros came to be, Ray-Ban wayfares’ were launched, a must-have accessory for the counterculture rebel of the 60s until more famous faces made the accessory mainstream, providing a cool look when you went out to take the trash. Finally, they became too widespread even for James Dean copycats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1984, Mr &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Sterling&quot;&gt;Bruce Sterling&lt;/a&gt;, another science fiction Hero, aggregates a set of short stories as a way of consolidating a new literary genre, born some years earlier and deeply rooted in the New Wave science fiction movement. Depending on whom you read, it was a pivotal work for the movement or a nail in the imagination coffin that should not depart from the box he created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://directionwithintent.com/images/mirrorshades.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks familiar, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That set of wayfarers’ look-alikes were a mark of the rebel counterculture that Cyberpunks were. In Mr Bruce Sterling own words from &lt;a href=&quot;http://project.cyberpunk.ru/idb/mirrorshades_preface.html&quot;&gt;Mirrorshades’ preface&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;” by hiding the eyes, mirrorshades prevent the forces of normalcy from realizing that one is crazed and possibly dangerous.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they were also a technological symbol that evolved during the Second World War. Material Engineering advances allowed brands to put the first mirrored ones on shelves in the 40s, and Ray-ban started selling their own models in the 70s.
Mirrorshades’ Cyberpunk stories would feature augmented humans, and a common theme would be vision as a digital interface masked by a sleek pair of Mirrorshades, sometimes surgically fused with flesh. Sometimes they would enhance eyesight, sometimes they overlay information from a remote system; other times, they just decorated reality with metadata.
At the extreme, they transport the user to a different reality, out of “meat space” and into something that we might call the Metaverse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going through the words of the literary masters of the New Wave and Cyberpunk movement would make you wonder when such technologies could be part of our day-to-day. The Cyberpunk Mirrorshades were the cybernetic interface that extended the bland reality of “meat space” into the rebel metaverse where few were allowed, and the dimensional hop provided superhuman digital habilities for the talented ones. The Wayfarers’ fitted perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dyson-halo&quot;&gt;Dyson Halo&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They didn’t make the cut, but they were probably the first attempt at what I would expect to be a vision wearable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://directionwithintent.com/images/dysonhalo.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2001 Dyson Halo’s promised augmented reality and a Siri type of virtual assistant, and I could imagine wall street traders at their offices roaming around the room, speaking loudly to the air while sporting such a clunky system. The typical user in the street? Not really.
After three years of research and investment, Dyson shelved the prototype and took patents to other appliances. I find Mr Dyson’s lack of faith disturbing, but their vacuums are pretty lovely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;transcend&quot;&gt;Transcend&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recon_Instruments&quot;&gt;Recon Instruments&lt;/a&gt;  closed shop in 2017 after being acquired by Intel in 2015. Probably they were the first company to put a successful “smart” eyewear device in the market. Their initial idea was a head-up display system, or simply HUD, integrated into swimmer goggles to inspect simple things like time spent, laps and basic swimmer statistics. Regrettably, a patent on such a system already existed, and the company decided to pivot sports instead of betting on a product with complicated and expensive manufacturing requirements.
Moving from swimming to Skiing also brought a technological strategy shift. Instead of going with the HUD, Recon switched to a peripheral head-mounted display. The first Transcend goggles were shipped in 2010 and were targeted to winter sports fans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://directionwithintent.com/images/recontranscend.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The device integrated an LCD screen, GPS and environmental sensors into stylish snow goggles.
Recon’s eventually created a proper decoupled HUD focusing on their technology objectives rather than the frames. With several product iterations, Jet, the last eyewear system from Recon Instruments, failed to impress the crowd after some poor reviews, and the technology wasn’t par with the expectations of such a device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;google-glass&quot;&gt;Google Glass&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enterprise Edition 2, launched in 2019, is the most recent version of the Optical Head-Mounted Display, or OHMD, from Google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://directionwithintent.com/images/googleglass.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first batch of Google glasses was shipped in 2013 for selected developers, but they were also was sold to qualified users in the same year.
Although they weren’t the first ones on the market, they are the best approximation of what one would expect of an eye wearable. Google ran many trials in different domains, testing and experimenting with extracting the best value of the technology. The private consumer market proved difficult, with privacy and security being the most significant problems that couldn’t be solved at the engineering level. To be fair, it isn’t difficult to imagine the clash between Google glass users and other citizens in the most varied environments. Even visual alerts for third parties that a user is recording isn’t enough since such safeguards can be tampered with easily.
In terms of fashion, they aren’t the most unobtrusive accessory, but they aren’t close to the clunky Dyson’s Halos that would probably require something like a fanny pack to pack up all the peripherals.
A single band with an OHMD and earpieces that can be mounted even on top of the prescribed lens isn’t hidden but can be acceptable in many professional environments where such a tool can help task execution and real-time documentation. I saw Mr Robert Scoble playing with ones at Websummit while speaking at a forum. His actions were quite distracting for the remaining panel, and it was apparent when Mr Scoble interacted with the frame and got sidetracked with some social app in his display.
The social time-slicing between real and virtual is unavoidable, but for a journalist taking statements from a politician right of a big announcement would be an interesting experiment. Real-time fact-checking with some incisive questions on the side. Who wouldn’t love it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;spectacles&quot;&gt;Spectacles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I present to you the Snapbot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://directionwithintent.com/images/snapbot.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Daylen and C.Suthorn / cc-by-sa-4.0 / &lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=60390917_&quot;&gt;commons.wikimedia.org, CC BY-SA 4.0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t be surprised if the designing team had some Japanese Manga inspiration when producing the vending machines that poped a pair of Spectacles for the modicum of 129 dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most recent product announcement from Snapchat builds on top of existing Spectacles that are only a pair of sunglasses coupled with one or more cameras depending on the version, transforming them into Augmented Reality, or simply AR, eyewear with the potential of using distributed computing for shared virtual experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://directionwithintent.com/images/spectacles.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are still in preview access for selected AR developers and enthusiasts, but Mr Spiegel’s presentation swole expectations with his short AR demo.
There’s a chance that Snap brings the first rich HUD displays to the private market and making the best from the current telecommunications technological landscape that still didn’t found good targets for consumer 5G networks.
The device look is very appealing to me, with lines that resemble Mr Elon’s Cybertruck, and this means that it’s something that the ordinary mortal will find ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ray-ban-stories&quot;&gt;Ray-Ban Stories&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunglasses with cameras, in-frame speakers. Also, you can take calls with them. That is it, in terms of “smart” features.
There isn’t much more than a pair of the old Snap’s Spectacles which is quite disappointing for a company that announces the Metaverse arrival right around the corner. Well, they have voice recognition but, be careful with water splash since the pair of glasses is too delicate, so I’m guessing that some forehead sweat might become an issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While “mainstream” has become a naughty word in the fashion industry, this isn’t the case for consumer electronics. If too many people use the same clothes or accessories, there’s a considerable probability that the wearable will be out of fashion soon enough but having an iPhone goes beyond the fashion statement. The smartphone is a complex device with a rich feature set that keeps transforming day-to-day human habits. Add style and looks on top of that, like Apple usually does with perfection, and you get a device that most of the consumers don’t get upset about if the next in line also has one. Now, observe the interaction of two fashionistas going into a party with the same outfit. Queue drama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Ray-Ban Stories are far from being a transformative device, Facebook did well partnering with a brand that produces the same fashion feeling when you cross paths with someone that owns the same accessory that you do. The frames don’t diverge much from traditional “dumb” ones in terms of style. The Wayfarers’ resemblance helps the format, even with the two visible peripheral cameras. I could use a pair, and most passersby’ wouldn’t even nudge their heads in my direction unless they got distracted with my good looks.
Assuming that Mr Zuckerberg meant what he said, this is a good move towards the eye wearables become more mainstream even with such a common feature set, but a far cry from my Cyberpunk prefered aesthetics and technological transformation. Unless we are talking about giant corporations that manipulate the world into their bidding. In that case, we are happily using the tools for our own demise. Don’t take these last couple of sentences seriously. They just look cool at the end of the text if you say them out loud with an ominous voice.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ll let you decide, but at the same time, when this sound was commonplace in many houses, thanks to Sir Sinclair, Mr William Gibson was releasing Neuromancer, one of the most essential books in the Cyberpunk genre. Molly Millions is the quintessential badass cybernetic enhanced girl within Neuromancer’s world that wreaks havoc on the streets. Her mirrorshades, surgically inlaid, augmented her vision and provided some other unspoken enhancements. Imagine Trinity from Matrix or Kusanagi from Ghost in the Shell to grasp an idea of this character. Mirrorshades became a Cyberpunk style token that resists until this day, hiding your corporate fighting intentions from the rest of the world. Ray-ban Stories are nothing like that, but if you squint enough from a distance, you might get a very fuzzy feeling of what the Cyberpunk genre promises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On September 9th, Thursday morning, Mr Mark Zuckerberg announced Ray-Ban Stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://directionwithintent.com/images/recontranscend.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The device integrated an LCD screen, GPS and environmental sensors into stylish snow goggles.
Recon’s eventually created a proper decoupled HUD focusing on their technology objectives rather than the frames. With several product iterations, Jet, the last eyewear system from Recon Instruments, failed to impress the crowd after some poor reviews, and the technology wasn’t par with the expectations of such a device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;google-glass&quot;&gt;Google Glass&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enterprise Edition 2, launched in 2019, is the most recent version of the Optical Head-Mounted Display, or OHMD, from Google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://directionwithintent.com/images/googleglass.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first batch of Google glasses was shipped in 2013 for selected developers, but they were also was sold to qualified users in the same year.
Although they weren’t the first ones on the market, they are the best approximation of what one would expect of an eye wearable. Google ran many trials in different domains, testing and experimenting with extracting the best value of the technology. The private consumer market proved difficult, with privacy and security being the most significant problems that couldn’t be solved at the engineering level. To be fair, it isn’t difficult to imagine the clash between Google glass users and other citizens in the most varied environments. Even visual alerts for third parties that a user is recording isn’t enough since such safeguards can be tampered with easily.
In terms of fashion, they aren’t the most unobtrusive accessory, but they aren’t close to the clunky Dyson’s Halos that would probably require something like a fanny pack to pack up all the peripherals.
A single band with an OHMD and earpieces that can be mounted even on top of the prescribed lens isn’t hidden but can be acceptable in many professional environments where such a tool can help task execution and real-time documentation. I saw Mr Robert Scoble playing with ones at Websummit while speaking at a forum. His actions were quite distracting for the remaining panel, and it was apparent when Mr Scoble interacted with the frame and got sidetracked with some social app in his display.
The social time-slicing between real and virtual is unavoidable, but for a journalist taking statements from a politician right of a big announcement would be an interesting experiment. Real-time fact-checking with some incisive questions on the side. Who wouldn’t love it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;spectacles&quot;&gt;Spectacles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I present to you the Snapbot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://directionwithintent.com/images/snapbot.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Daylen and C.Suthorn / cc-by-sa-4.0 / &lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=60390917_&quot;&gt;commons.wikimedia.org, CC BY-SA 4.0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t be surprised if the designing team had some Japanese Manga inspiration when producing the vending machines that poped a pair of Spectacles for the modicum of 129 dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most recent product announcement from Snapchat builds on top of existing Spectacles that are only a pair of sunglasses coupled with one or more cameras depending on the version, transforming them into Augmented Reality, or simply AR, eyewear with the potential of using distributed computing for shared virtual experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://directionwithintent.com/images/spectacles.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are still in preview access for selected AR developers and enthusiasts, but Mr Spiegel’s presentation swole expectations with his short AR demo.
There’s a chance that Snap brings the first rich HUD displays to the private market and making the best from the current telecommunications technological landscape that still didn’t found good targets for consumer 5G networks.
The device look is very appealing to me, with lines that resemble Mr Elon’s Cybertruck, and this means that it’s something that the ordinary mortal will find ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ray-ban-stories&quot;&gt;Ray-Ban Stories&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunglasses with cameras, in-frame speakers. Also, you can take calls with them. That is it, in terms of “smart” features.
There isn’t much more than a pair of the old Snap’s Spectacles which is quite disappointing for a company that announces the Metaverse arrival right around the corner. Well, they have voice recognition but, be careful with water splash since the pair of glasses is too delicate, so I’m guessing that some forehead sweat might become an issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While “mainstream” has become a naughty word in the fashion industry, this isn’t the case for consumer electronics. If too many people use the same clothes or accessories, there’s a considerable probability that the wearable will be out of fashion soon enough but having an iPhone goes beyond the fashion statement. The smartphone is a complex device with a rich feature set that keeps transforming day-to-day human habits. Add style and looks on top of that, like Apple usually does with perfection, and you get a device that most of the consumers don’t get upset about if the next in line also has one. Now, observe the interaction of two fashionistas going into a party with the same outfit. Queue drama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Ray-Ban Stories are far from being a transformative device, Facebook did well partnering with a brand that produces the same fashion feeling when you cross paths with someone that owns the same accessory that you do. The frames don’t diverge much from traditional “dumb” ones in terms of style. The Wayfarers’ resemblance helps the format, even with the two visible peripheral cameras. I could use a pair, and most passersby’ wouldn’t even nudge their heads in my direction unless they got distracted with my good looks.
Assuming that Mr Zuckerberg meant what he said, this is a good move towards the eye wearables become more mainstream even with such a common feature set, but a far cry from my Cyberpunk prefered aesthetics and technological transformation. Unless we are talking about giant corporations that manipulate the world into their bidding. In that case, we are happily using the tools for our own demise. Don’t take these last couple of sentences seriously. They just look cool at the end of the text if you say them out loud with an ominous voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;obituary---sir-sinclair-youth-waster&quot;&gt;Obituary - Sir Sinclair, youth waster&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;september-17&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;September 17&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The title of this piece sounds like a phrase uttered by a conservative parent that thinks that computer games waste our youth. I’d have none of that, and it’s a fond way of explaining my brief interactions with a ZX Spectrum tape computer, one of Sir Sinclair creations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I come from humble origins, but some of my friends had personal computers at their homes in the late 80s or early 90s. Some, even more than one, but the ZX Spectrum was the most common computer for “kids” with their tape loaders that could waste half an hour or more to load a program into resident memory, and they failed many times. If it died more than a couple of times, a bit of head tape reader cleaning was in demand. The loading sound is probably burned in so many minds that it will trigger anxiety attacks on the spot. Will it load?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sir Sinclair was born into a family of Engineers and at one of the worst times and places of the last century. London in the forties with “The Blitz” at its heights.
His family ran away from the war epicentre as soon as possible, establishing themselves in more bucolic locations, away from the bombs.
Soon enough, Sir Sinclair showed above-average skills in mathematics and modern technology. His knowledge and abilities allowed an easy entry into the world of digital circuitry with his first creation in his late teens and many more in his twenties, when he founded Sinclair Radionics, his first company. From this point until 1982, when Timex sold the first ZX Spectrum in the United States, Sir Sinclair pinballed here and there, fighting for his creations and losing battles with contenders like Acorn Computers, a company founded by an ex-employee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The price tag and modern features of the ZX Spectrum made the computer a fun gift for young adults that could “play” with the programming interface in their rooms. From here to indy games, it’s just a pair or years, and with this new market emerging from Spectrum “bedroom coders”, Sinclair Research, the name of Sir Sinclair company at that time, reached success even in the Soviet bloc where ZX Spectrum clones could be found everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His love for electric vehicles was well-known, and with the capital from Sinclair Research, he was able to start Sinclair Vehicles and a few other unsuccessful ventures until Sinclair Research became a three employee company in 1990.
His last attempt in the electric vehicle market failed in 2010 and was still inspired by his first endeavours into electric mobility equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still remember seeing the local grocery store owner programming on a ZX Spectrum system. Without any education besides the primary Portuguese mandatory grade at the time, he read translations from the programming guides and got help from neighbours who understood English for those that weren’t translated. I played question and answer games that he developed while attending patrons and dealing with street rascals, myself included. He also did accounting with the thing, but that was way over my understanding at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://directionwithintent.com/images/sinclair.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Farewell, Sir Sinclair and thanks for all the computers.&lt;/p&gt;

        	&lt;img src=&quot;https://directionwithintent.com/images/Banner_MVJournal_banner_13.png&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        	&lt;p&gt;In our second MV Journal Follow-up, we will review a few topics that stopped at a cliff-hanger…or something similar, I guess, but if someone asks you what the best thing you got from this post was, you can point the person to &lt;a href=&quot;https://mcbroken.com/&quot;&gt;McBroken&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re cruising around the USA, never forget to check if the nearest MacDonalds has a working McFlurry machine. 
Amazed? The internet produces great things, right? Unless you’re a developer mandated to use a Cloud-based IDE. In that case, I’m not sure we’re going in the right direction, but the verdict is still out here on this one. Let’s have a few words if you get to try one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#the-resource-balance-loop---remote-development-ides-are-back-again&quot;&gt;The Resource Balance Loop - Remote Development IDEs are back again&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#mv-journal-follow-up&quot;&gt;MV Journal Follow-up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-resource-balance-loop---remote-development-ides-are-back-again&quot;&gt;The Resource Balance Loop - Remote Development IDEs are back again&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;august-31&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;August 31&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the olden days of mainframes, from the mid 1970’s to the mid 1980’s, most people used real text-terminals to communicate with large computers. These real text-terminals were neither computers nor emulated text-terminals. They consisted only of a screen, keyboard, and only enough memory to store a screenfull or so of text (a few kilobytes). Users typed in programs, ran programs, wrote documents, issued printing commands, etc. A cable connected the terminal to the computer (often indirectly). It was called a terminal since it was located at the terminal end of this cable. Some text-terminals were called “graphic” but the resolution was poor and the speed slow by today’s standards due to the high cost of memory and the limited speed of the conventional serial port, etc.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Text excerpt from &lt;a href=&quot;https://linux.die.net/HOWTO/Text-Terminal-HOWTO-1.html&quot;&gt;linux.die.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A decade ago ( probably more), I was again at the doctor’s office with yet another case of tonsillitis. The procedure was always the same. A throat inspection to assess the situation and few questions to understand if I had to go with an antibiotics prescription. This time I noticed some differences at the doctor’s desk. A very slim LCD with an inconspicuous “Siemens” sticker, keyboard and mouse. No visible tower.
After a few seconds, the doctor apologises for the time it took to just get a prescription.  She says, “This is only a monitor. They told me that the computer is at the Hospital.”
The comment wasn’t completely random since she started the consultation with a few questions, including my occupation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It made perfect sense at the time. A closed system for hospitals where all resident activities at the desktop were well-defined. A mainframe alike setup with some slim hosts would be enough for day to day work. The application layer would be a different problem altogether, but the concentration of resources at the Hospital data centre would suffice.
Back at the office, after recovering from my infirmities, I’ve shared the setup with my manager, and he pointed me out that we were going to have a similar architecture for call centres with “dumb hosts” replacing existing desktops. “Back to the past”, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last decades, we’ve seen a back and forth with resources shifting from computation aggregates, whether data centres or mainframe setups, to user desktops and back again. Reasons vary from security concerns to monetary restrictions, going through systems maintenance and upgrades. For me, it was never clear, and my preference would always fall into capable desktops with good intranet or internet connectivity but primarily for convenience and ignoring all the other corporate aspects that the C suite needs to weigh in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the development world, even with the advent of large scale data processing with Hadoop and all the tools derived from the Map-Reduce revolution, we still saw Engineers and Programmers wanting powerful machines that can run all the tools simultaneously and mimic production environments. Rarely I’ve seen developers working in remote environments and liking the experience. You might need a database running outside your local environment or to interact with a development message queue, but if the developer can contain the technology zoo in a local pen, they will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the Cloud eating Software everywhere, running complex environments locally became almost impossible. Most of the tools aren’t readily available to install locally, and some require too many resources, even for powerful machines. Take, for instance, the very simple SQS from AWS, a message queue only available in the Cloud or Forecast, an AI system design for resource demand forecast also from AWS. Are you guessing where this is going? “Back to the past”, I say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud providers and big software players are already moving into the online code editors and pushing developers to the new IDE, the Browser.
This isn’t new if you’re only doing front-end development since browser development tools tabs are a significant part of the process. We’ve also seen the proliferation of sites such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://codepen.io/&quot;&gt;Codepen&lt;/a&gt; where developers can try examples, edit and run them with the usual mix of HTML, Javascript and CSS, but at the end of the day, you still need to keep your project running locally. Every other task unrelated to front-end technologies isn’t well covered, although it’s possible to see a few solid websites that run C# or Java snippets with environmental constraints such as I/O and connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;August 11, Github announces that they are migrating all internal development to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/features/codespaces&quot;&gt;Codespaces&lt;/a&gt;.
Mr Cory Wilkerson is a Senior Director of Engineering at GitHub. He paints a rosy picture in his &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.blog/2021-08-11-githubs-engineering-team-moved-codespaces/&quot;&gt;blog post announcing the shift to the cloud work environment&lt;/a&gt;, but it takes some development iterations to get the feel of such a change. I’m sure that we’ll have an MV Journal Follow-up on this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/&quot;&gt;Cloud9&lt;/a&gt; is the development environment from AWS. A quick visit to the product website features a “Benefits” header followed by “Code with just a browser”. At first glance, I get scared with such a statement. Whether at Codespaces or Cloud9, the Browser brings a set of hidden moving parts on top of an insecurity layer. It isn’t a benefit per se, although I’m willing to accept that it is a ubiquitous piece of Software with a high level of accessibility, that is it. From a developer standpoint, showing a few code shops at your parent’s computer might be amusing, but doing it professionally requires a sensible setup that goes well beyond the Browser. Check your chair and desk, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Azure Notebooks is another type of Cloud IDE that packages &lt;a href=&quot;https://jupyter.org/&quot;&gt;Jupyter&lt;/a&gt; Notebooks, the fundamental technology of this product. Jupyter is a non-profit open-source project that provides a Python development environment that primarily targeted data scientists and machine learning enthusiasts. It gives an integrated environment with many pre-installed libraries tools for data processing and graphics display. Nowadays, the project encompasses more programming languages, but the true benefit of this environment lies in its hybrid approach. You can develop your code remotely via your Browser or download the Jupyter Notebook onto your machine and extract all the power from your local machine instead of paying for Azure computation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I would like to mention &lt;a href=&quot;https://observablehq.com/product&quot;&gt;Observable&lt;/a&gt; co-founded by the visualisation guru &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mbostock&quot;&gt;Mike Bostok&lt;/a&gt;. The objective of Observable is to provide a development environment to present data in the best way possible. You can see an Observable Notebook as a refinement of a Jupyter Notebook made purely for data presentation, although it can also take considerable amounts of computation. I could see such an environment feasible for data scientists that focus primarily on data interpretation and presentation, falling into my tonsilitis diagnosing doctor type of work.
They also provide extension points using third-party packages as long as they are supplied via PyPi, but the breath of visualisation libraries already available will probably deter you from taking the hard path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll find many flavours of online editors, and I bet that more will show up from companies like Jetbrains. Still, I’m not old enough to see the dumb terminal approach as a reliable way of doing development work, at least in heterogeneous environments where Engineers have a wide array of skills and don’t fall on narrow domains such as front-end development or data presentation. Nevertheless, I will check Cloud9 for some microservice work at &lt;a href=&quot;https://metric.pt&quot;&gt;Metric&lt;/a&gt; and maybe get converted to the Browser way…but don’t bet on it :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;mv-journal-follow-up&quot;&gt;MV Journal Follow-up&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;september-3&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;September 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;waking-up-at-basecamp&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://directionwithintent.com/mvjournal/mvjournal_5/#waking-up-at-basecamp&quot;&gt;Waking up at Basecamp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May 20, a couple of weeks after my piece about Basecamp, Mr David Heinemeier, or DHH as he’s known online, published an article with the title &lt;a href=&quot;https://world.hey.com/dhh/after-the-storm-9370f871&quot;&gt;After the storm&lt;/a&gt;.
Even now, it’s too soon for such a sentiment, but Mr DHH reports that after a minor blip in departing customers, business bounced back and kept growing as expected.
One of my previous managers usually said, “The cemetery is home for many irreplaceable heroes”, and this sentiment is shared in Mr DHH words regarding departed employees. Life goes on at Basecamp with new employees and customers huddling around the fire of a successful business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;market-wars-with-epic-battles&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://directionwithintent.com/mvjournal/mvjournal_7/#market-wars-with-epic-battles&quot;&gt;Market wars with Epic battles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It escalated.
Epic is pushing buttons all over the world, testing law limits but still waiting for the jury. Australia was the last country to accept Epic’s claims in court, and another legal battle will pit Epic against Apple in this World Market Wars. The strategy looks clear enough for us, mortal bystanders. A good victory in any country might trigger a cascade in the remaining courts and/or push Apple to make changes globally instead of managing each country market as a vertical.
In between, Apple is losing ground with lawsuits eroding its claims and forcing changes even before Epic enters the ring.
A class-action suit from 2019 ended in August, with Apple conceding to make changes that allow app developers to redirect users to alternative payment options. This is a step toward an Epic win, but the amusing part lies on the judge. Miss Yvonne Gonzalez-Rogers is the Californian judge overseeing the class-action suit settlement, but she also presides Epic vs Apple.
Far from California, South Korea dealt a significant blow to every digital Market, and it will make a profit dent on big players such as Apple. 
The &lt;a href=&quot;http://likms.assembly.go.kr/bill/billDetail.do?billId=PRC_E2Z1F0E7F2Y0Q1S1N3B4Y5U2A2K2P9&quot;&gt;bill&lt;/a&gt; ( I recommend the “translate” option of your favourite Browser to take a peek) establishes that digital market makers need to allow third-party payment systems. Not only that but also added provisions to avoid delays in application approvals and blocks that might be used to deter companies from going outside the app store.
Apple and Google are indisputable giant whales with their digital markets, but it looks like the law takes the underdog side. Let’s wait again for a few months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ai-pair-programming&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://directionwithintent.com/mvjournal/mvjournal_10/#ai-pair-programming&quot;&gt;AI Pair Programming&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I’ll start declaring that Copilot is a failure, at least for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Brendan Dolan-Gavitt is an Assistant Professor at NYU Tandon. He noticed some strange configurations in Github’ Copilot Visual Studio Code extension to detect less desirable words. You can follow his tweet sequence about this digital adventure &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/moyix/status/1433254293352730628&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but one of his findings was very entertaining. The extension uses a black list of words to censor input, and within that set, one can find “q rsqrt”. If you’re not familiar with the string, I’ll help you. Originally it is Q_rqrt, the Quake fast inverse function that Copilot regurgitated as an auto-complete option.
Mr Brendan tweets reveal much more, but this extension is just one more example of how not to do it.
But it’s not all. A recent paper suggests that &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.09293&quot;&gt;40 per cent of Copilot’s suggestions are erroneous from a security point of view&lt;/a&gt;. This shouldn’t be a shock considering my article. Copilot’s training codebase was feed as is. Who would have guessed that it would drop such foul code?
I’m keen on loonshots and hope that Copilot becomes a successful tool to help development in many ways, but right now, I defer to my first sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;i-legally-fixit&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://directionwithintent.com/mvjournal/mvjournal_11/#i-legally-fixit&quot;&gt;i (legally) Fixit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, this is a tangent to the original article, but it shows that anyone can be impacted by repair restrictions, even the fast-food giant MacDonalds.
At least in the United States, you’ll need some good alignment from the ice cream gods to get a taste of a Macflurry. The failing ice cream machines are a running joke on the internet, and even MacDonalds took the internet’s side with the tweet:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://directionwithintent.com/images/macfunny.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually, when I went for a surfing bout, I  visited a beach webcam site to see if the surf was actually up. If you want a Macflurry, you better pay a visit to &lt;a href=&quot;https://mcbroken.com/&quot;&gt;McBroken&lt;/a&gt; and see if the local machine is working.
Not having a Macflurry whenever you want to visit a MacDonalds has become a severe issue for the USA’s Federal Trade Committee or FTC. Funny aside, the FTC is probing MacDonalds since it seems that HQ doesn’t allow franchisees to fix their own machines, which leads to long wait times until customers can get their tasty treat. I’m on FTC’s side on this one for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

        	&lt;p&gt;It’s no secret that I’m an AWS fanboy, but one shouldn’t be clouded by the halo effects of your favourite brands. AWS is going out of line with Elastic, and we need to talk about it. Yet, we find ourselves in another unusual holiday period. Restrictions here and there make travel a risky business. Still, finally, I’m seeing more energy in the air and people going out, taking advantage of Portugal amazing summer weather…unless we are talking about Blizzard or World of Warcraft, where temperatures are going against climate change predictions. Grab a warm coat and check for yourself down below!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;july-30th&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;July 30th&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warcraft II made me lose myself behind CRTs, or Cathode-ray tube monitors if you’re a youngster, for so many hours that I’m even ashamed to admit. Before gaming laptops, carrying a desktop from house to house for a weekend, binge playing in multiplayer mode, or just raising up a “civ”, short for civilisation, to crush AI opponents with the glory and might that this earth only saw a few times.
Warcraft II has a special place in my games pantheon and probably for many more young souls from my generation.
But the world keeps revolving, and, with internet speeds increasing and ping times going down, MMOG, Massive Multiplayer Online Games took the lion share of gamers attention.
I’ve lost the train on that trend and kept myself for first-person shooter games such as America’s Army or Unreal Tournament, but I digress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in the day, digital online games were a boys club as so many other pastimes. They’d made those environments harsh and impenetrable for so many others who just wanted to have fun with things and people they loved. You’ll have a mix of decent people that want to have fun and keep fruitful online relations, but you also have “jocks” and trolls ruining the space for the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/nchattinl/&quot;&gt;Miss Nicole Chattin&lt;/a&gt; is an Events and Communications Manager right here at Multivision. Some months ago, I saw her going for a Call of Duty round in our own Playstation 5 and found out that she was in a Counter-Strike league back at home, “t-shirts and all”, as she said. I’ve recently asked her if she found the gamer environment friendly when she raised hell on her opponents. “All cool”. An older friend introduced her to the majestic universe of first-person shooters, and that was it. Fun all the time.
Hold on to that faith restoration. It is still a bumpy ride in this piece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward a decade, and the environment is more mixed but probably less civilised. At Activision Blizzard, we also see the gamer’s environment seeping into the game developers world. Who wondered such a thing? Everybody did, as long as you paid some attention to game shops, developers and C suite bro clubs.
Well, we’ve seen this behaviour everywhere, didn’t we? It isn’t intrinsic in the gaming industry. It’s just another example of bad group behaviour that goes unpunished for too much time, becoming accepted, even by the victims, that last the ordeal to keep doing what they love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lawsuit-in-the-making&quot;&gt;Lawsuit in the making&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past two years,  Activision Blizzard was under investigation by California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing for alleged harassment and discrimination of female employees. July 21st, Bloomberg Law reports the result of the inquiry. &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/activision-blizzard-sued-by-california-over-frat-boy-culture&quot;&gt;Blizzard is being sued on multiple accounts&lt;/a&gt;.
If you have the patience, you can read the full court filing &lt;a href=&quot;https://aboutblaw.com/YJw&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
Some of the accounts are deeply disturbing, and some stemming right from the top. Presumably, the most problematic is related to the suicide of a female employee on a company trip. Although the event isn’t related to most of the allegations in the court filing, it shows the type of frat culture going around at Blizzard’s HQ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;leadership-reaction&quot;&gt;Leadership reaction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One would expect that acknowledging the problem and dealing with the lawsuit would be the way to go. Still, Ms Fran Townsend, VP for corporate affairs, corporate secretary, and chief compliance officer since March of this year, made a public written statement striking back the lawsuit. She doubles down on the first Activision Blizzard’s statement that downplayed the events portrayed in the accusation, saying that the company already changed to deal with such issues and that cases were false or distorted. Which one it is?
Ms Townsend also reinforced the message that the suit is unfair since most of the accounts are outdated, inaccurate, and some are even false. The strategy ricochet pretty fast.
To be fair, the worst statements came from Activision Blizzard HQ, which holds Blizzard Entertainment amongst other business branches. The latter upper echelon took an empathetic position sharing their concerns and apologies, taking the side of ex and current employees that are victims of the alleged harassment culture. Many ex-leaders also made their apologies public, some acknowledging the behaviours, some others assumed blame for their alleged ignorance about the facts and environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;employee-retaliation&quot;&gt;Employee retaliation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activision Blizzard C-suite’s hardline response wasn’t appreciated by the workforce, to say the least.
After Ms Townsend statement, several current and ex-employees went public on Twitter sharing their animosity regarding her narrative and recounting some events where such behaviours were blatant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to point out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wowhead.com/news/former-blizzard-employees-speak-up-about-activision-blizzard-323560&quot;&gt;the collection of tweets from Ms Christina Womack&lt;/a&gt;, a Former Senior User Experience Designer at Battle.net. This is an excellent example of some of the allegations within the lawsuit. 
In a united front, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wowhead.com/news/activision-blizzard-employees-publish-open-letter-criticizing-activisions-323564?fbclid=IwAR3dTIgCr9KZkRVa4jq7Mjn9NkG-rMRkIVH5m3H9ulX2D7zEgg2IJ220aeU&quot;&gt;Blizzard’s employees presented an open letter condemning the facts pertaining to the lawsuit and the leadership response to it.&lt;/a&gt;
With more than 3K peers signing the letter, the workforce further organised a walkout to protest managements’ position while demanding structural changes in company policies, from recruitment to career and salary progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fallout&quot;&gt;Fallout&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Bobby Kotick, Activision Blizzard’s CEO, tried to make amends with employees, acknowledging that their first reaction wasn’t fitting. Still, they aren’t the only stakeholders feeling the heat from the bombshell.
It has been a bumpy ride for Activision Blizzard’s stock since Bloomberg  Law, a data analytics and AI company, released the news,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wowhead.com/news/investor-rights-law-firms-launch-securities-claims-investigations-against-323598&quot;&gt;and some investors weren’t happy with the surprise.&lt;/a&gt;
Failing to disclose such an essential fact for a publicly-traded company might be a severe breach of their fiduciary duties. Although it is a usual class action suit when a stock is affected by such events that come from nowhere, it adds to Activision Blizzard’s mess. And it does not end here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;on-other-lousy-news&quot;&gt;On other lousy news&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gamers and content creators aren’t happy, to make matters worse, and it isn’t solely related to Activision Blizzard’s lawsuit.
While game developers are fighting companies inner demons, they are also being accused of doing shoddy work with Blizzard’s flagship game, World of Warcraft, or WoW as it is usually referred to.
Two of the most famous content creators, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXJL3ST-O0J3nqzQyPJtpNg&quot;&gt;Preach Gaming&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOvz3kkYZtCTeXKdiuMG8eg&quot;&gt;MadSeasonShow&lt;/a&gt;, are abandoning the game. Besides their concerns about the recent news about Blizzard’s work environment, they point out some horrible game development decisions in the last years. From &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-shadowlands-upcoming-shards-of-domination-system-is-leaving-players-frustrated/1100-6493247/&quot;&gt;game mechanics&lt;/a&gt;, including paid level boosts and the WoW Token, which is more or less paying for a win. Level boosts carry your character to a higher power ranking allowing the player to enter into combat in more demanding environments instead of enduring the grind of levelling up. With WoW tokens, the player can buy game currency with real money. Game currency, referred to as WoW gold, allows a player to purchase artefacts. It is another way to pay for progress instead of fighting for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And again, stakeholders battle each other on Twitter, this time with heated arguments flying between system designers and players, with the latter asking for new system designers and developers striking back just like Ms Townsend did. Maybe designers should pay attention to gamer’s complaints about the lousy game mechanics installed for the last four years, just like Activision Blizzard leadership should pay more attention to their poisonous work environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/duarte-faria/&quot;&gt;Duarte Faria&lt;/a&gt;, a Software Developer at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.helloprint.com/&quot;&gt;HelloPrint&lt;/a&gt;, plays at Zanity, a WoW guild, says that this is his last tier. Although he assumes that the game doesn’t have the same appeal as before, the latest developments were the final push to change his gaming habits.
One has to consider that WoW was launched in 2004. It is one of the games that endured most and has a fandom that loves the game, sometimes in an unhealthy fashion, with reports of &lt;a href=&quot;https://venturebeat.com/2015/03/05/man-dies-after-19-hour-world-of-warcraft-session/&quot;&gt;gamers dying while playing the game for days in a row.&lt;/a&gt;. 
The environment was always rude, and after almost 20 years, it is hard to keep it fresh for gamers who grew with it. With an ambience loaded with so many bad feelings, one might think the community could be better with something similar to [Dungeon Keeper], where evil is good.
It might be the end of an era. I just wonder if we are going to get another Blizzard expansion of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;aws-stretching-elastic-patience&quot;&gt;AWS stretching Elastic patience&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWS Glue sparked my interest for a while, and I even did a presentation about it at our humble &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meetup.com/AWS-User-Group-Lisbon/events/243203888/&quot;&gt;AWS Lisbon User Group&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, it wasn’t suited to my needs, but I did deliver it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While spiking my way with Glue, I’ve found that they were using Grok patterns to filter data from text streams. I was familiar with Grok since I’d been working with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elastic.co/logstash/&quot;&gt;Logstash&lt;/a&gt; even before being acquired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elastic.co/&quot;&gt;Elastic&lt;/a&gt; so it was interesting to see that AWS supported such open-source initiatives.
My mistake.
In any of the documents or tutorials was a reference to Logstash or Jordan Sissel, the creator of Logstash and the Grok patterns library that they used.
It felt odd that no mention was given. Still, I guessed that official documentation was trying to be as straightforward as possible, avoiding references that did not add much for users in general. So I tried to vindicate Jordan with an explicit reference to him at my talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;its-open-source-deal-with-it&quot;&gt;It’s open-source; deal with it&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWS uses many open-source artefacts in their products and services. Still, sometimes they just integrate software into AWS and resell it as a product or service using their virtual environments. One example is Elasticsearch.
It’s hard to understand some open-source licenses and what can you do without infringing them,  but in this case, AWS was, and it is free to use it and sell the service as they see fit. And they do it since 2015 using the brand Amazon Elasticsearch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://directionwithintent.com/images/awselasticfakepartenership.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the first moment of tension between both companies since there wasn’t any acknowledged collaboration between them. Elasticsearch, a registered trademark, was being used abusively by Amazon, according to Elastic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fork-you&quot;&gt;Fork you&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While tension increased with time, Elastic also caught another service provider redhanded with Elastic’s commercial code in their offerings. Of course, this should be a separate issue, but some of that code went in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch/&quot;&gt;Open Distro for  Elasticsearch&lt;/a&gt;, a software fork that AWS created in 2019. 
One can speculate much about the arguments and decisions of such a fork. Still, it was evident that AWS was already preparing for keeping “their” Elasticsearch version protected from future license changes, which happened at the beginning of this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;elastic-limit&quot;&gt;Elastic limit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elasticity ends when a body can’t resist further distorting influences. In January, Elastic reached that point and decided to go back on their 2018 promise of keeping their licences open forever, when they’ve opened &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elastic.co/what-is/open-x-pack&quot;&gt;X-pack&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, they’ve updated their licencing terms with a Server Side Public License or SSPL and updated their previous statement to reflect the transition. 
I’ll state again that some licences are complex to navigate for most developers, but I’ll try a crude simplification in this piece. The “new” SSPL tries to prevent third parties from selling services based on “Open Source” artefacts if they don’t provide all source code involved in such offering. This is a brake for big integrators and resellers who can’t establish clear boundaries between services, orchestration, and integration components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fauxpenning&quot;&gt;Fauxpenning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SSPL isn’t considered genuinely Open Source by the community, and Elastic knows it well. Licences such as SSPL are referred to as fauxpen, a word derived from “false open”. In a sense, they mimic most of the open-source tenents but limit the user in some way. Nevertheless, Elastic probably saw the license fit as a weapon for fighting tech companies that allegedly abused the Open Source community. Still, it’s obviously a sword with two edges since it removes the freedom of doing whatever you want with the code.
The license was created by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mongodb.com/&quot;&gt;MongoDB&lt;/a&gt; in 2018 with the same objective and targetting the same offender.
AWS made the same choice that it did now. MongoDB became DocumentDB for AWS customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;we-the-users&quot;&gt;We, the users&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Elastic, the license change will not bring anything new or uncertain for most users and the community for the foreseeable future
but there are a few caveats.
The AWS pledge of keeping a fully open-source Elasticsearch, which will be renamed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://opensearch.org/&quot;&gt;OpenSearch&lt;/a&gt;, doesn’t come quite sincere, but it will respect the open-source tenets making it free to use it as one sees fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Elastic began changing existing clients and libraries to refuse connections to OpenSearch clusters, pushing AWS to accelerate development efforts in their own libraries and forks. This is an issue for users that live on the bleeding edge. Migration to a new version requires deciding where to put the chips, especially if you manage hybrid deployments.
Even if you opt for stable installations, security patches might force you to decide too quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my part, and putting ethics on the side, I believe that an integrated environment within AWS will benefit speed of development, deployment and cost control. It is hard to compete with AWS excellent Infrastructure as a Code platform, all of your artefacts in one cloud and, integration features between many services and products. However, if you’re using a  hybrid deployment and your cloud provider is any other than AWS, it will probably be the same, excluding costs that vary between providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;them-the-developers&quot;&gt;Them, the developers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open-source developers and maintainers will have to decide where their efforts should be placed and if compatibility should be a concern. AWS promises to be compatible up to the forked version and states that one of their biggest concerns is to keep backwards compatibility for users happy with older deployments that don’t see updates often. OpenSearch eventually will become a different beast, such as DocumentDB diverged from MongoDB and Aurora from MySQL.
I don’t believe that we’ll see much enthusiasm from developers that poured their hearts into Elasticsearch codebase, making the switch, maybe excluding some hardliners from the open-source community that don’t align themselves with Elastic “fauxpenning” strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While one understands the abusive behaviour from AWS, it is also hard to see the mix between paid and non paid software in the Elastic component ensemble that does not flow to the community for many open-source enthusiasts. 
Nevertheless, this is the case with so many labels that work both fronts and need to make money to pay employees, developers and investors. AWS knows this, but their business will ultimately stand on AWS integrations and a top of the line cloud infrastructure. Selling software on running on the latter is the way to go, but AWS product development follows instead of innovating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWS portfolio also shows that they can endure fights with almost anyone and come out as a winner while building up a panoply of products and services that don’t fall. On the Elastic side, the main problem of trademark abuse will go away with OpenSearch. Leaving AWS quiet, for now, would be wise, but joining forces with companies that suffered the same fate would be fruitful for potential confrontations and to build an open-source movement that makes a trade-off between licencing fundamentalism and intellectual common property protection.&lt;/p&gt;

        	&lt;p&gt;Two billionaires went to the edge of Space, and the world rebelled. Well, not entirely, but many voices raised concerns against expensive and environmentally unfriendly trips. Avoiding ethics and morals in this edition, I’m all up for the trips and cheering each successful space hop hoping that we work to go even further.
But imagine that you’re aboard your private Dragon Crew cabin on your way to Mars. The oxygen scrubber fails, and there are two options. Should you bring your capsule back to Earth for service or replace it mid-flight? While the answer might seem obvious, current affairs will cause you dismay. Even if you think that it would not happen if lives were at stake, let me remind you that in the current Coronavirus pandemic. Many hospitals could not fix their own equipment for respiratory support since vendors don’t supply parts or manuals.
Two topics for a few minutes of your reading time. Probably a few more to digest it all the way. Join me in another MV Journal edition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;july-23th&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;July 23th&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine yourself on the road, driving to one of your favourite weekend destinations, when a dreadful stinger abandoned on the road inserts itself on a front tire of your brand new car. You get out to check the damage, and with some relief, you find that it was only rubber that got damaged. Mustering some patience and will, you pop the trunk and search for a monkey wrench that should be near the spare tire. After a few minutes of search, you get nothing. You pick your car manual to see where they’ve hidden the goods, and to your surprise, they aren’t hidden at all. They don’t exist. There’s only a phone number within the “tire replacement” section that you can call and ask for assistance. Frustration creeps in, but you set your mind at ease and dial the number. A helpful assistant tells you that you need to take your car to the nearest approved repair shop for a new tire and the replacement service. She also warns you to avoid third-party repair shops or else your vehicle will be rendered unusable. “Unbricking” the car will add to your expense on top of a voided warranty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although this might seem far fetched, it’s more or less what some farming equipment manufacturers ask from their clients. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deere.com/en/index.html&quot;&gt;John Deere&lt;/a&gt; is a well-known brand for farming heavy equipment. Every new series brings more tech that locks out owners from trivial repairs to the point that some started to hack their own rigs with shady software. You can find an in-depth piece from &lt;a href=&quot;https://vice.com&quot;&gt;Vice&lt;/a&gt; right &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en/article/v7m8mx/john-deere-promised-farmers-it-would-make-tractors-easy-to-repair-it-lied&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we might think this is weird, to say the least, for such equipment, it’s what’s happening for more than a decade, with many technology brands around the world being Apple and Samsung, the most notorious ones due to their virtual shelf omnipresence.
And the problem isn’t only the warnings or soft threats from the vendors. They sign contracts with part manufacturers that impose restrictions on whom they might sell replacements, shielding supply chains from outside buyers, including product owners. Even with a voided warranty and enough skill to repair your equipment, it will be hard to find a seller with compatible parts. If this isn’t enough, vendors go further, creating exotic bindings that require tools that only the original brand produces and sells at a premium. Yes, Apple. We’re looking at you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The struggle between consumers and brands for access to replacement hardware and manuals which would allow anyone to repair their own devices has been branded as “The Right to Repair”.
The problem became more accentuated in the last decade. Still, with some clever footwork, one can go back to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescencehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence&quot;&gt;Planned Obsolescence&lt;/a&gt; strategy that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks_Stevens&quot;&gt;Mr Brooks Stevens&lt;/a&gt; introduced in the middle of the last century. In few words, the main idea is to create new products that improve slightly compared to the previous generation that gets discontinued or deprecated before its valid life expectancy.
The strategy survived until now, but it was stretched to the point where consumers started to rebel when they are forced to deliver their equipment in authorised brand counters for repair, usually at a premium. The alternative is to buy the new and improved version for a little more money than the repair would cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers felt the consumer pressure from some civic movements and “do it yourself” online champions, or DIY as generally referred to. In the United States of America, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ifixit.com/&quot;&gt;iFixit&lt;/a&gt;, a website with DIY repair tutorials, is one of the most prominent defenders of the “Right to Repair”. Mr Kyle Wiens, iFixit CEO, usually denounces vendors’ tactics to block users from essential parts and documentation that would allow anyone to do basic maintenance tasks.
The “Right to Repair” reached Europe as well, but European Union lawmakers are leading the bureaucratic effort although they’ve started public earings well before the United States. Unfortunately, current legislation since the beginning of the year fell short for the DIY community. Manufacturers need to extend the period where repair parts are available to professionals. It should be no less than ten years, which will further push the life expectancy of electronic products such as smartphones and tablets rendered unusable after 3 to 5 years if any part fails.
Although the law forces an extension of the planned obsolescence strategy, it left out the owner that wants to buy the parts and avoid the expense of sending their hardware to a repair shop.
The United Kingdom did something more aligned with the “Right to Repair” movement and well-balanced for consumers and vendors. Lawmakers created a particular class of parts that anyone can replace and another type of parts available to professional repair shops, following more or less the same European Union directives. Any car owner can follow the logic. Tires and lights should be easily replaced, but a gearbox might require professional attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the United States, the new Biden administration brought lawmakers that already felt that tech companies exert more power than they should. This last week the Federal Trade Commission, or simply FTC, voted unanimously to enforce laws that will make the “Right to Repair” accessible to any product consumer. 
Also, consumers should be aware that the law was already on their side. Since 1975, the Magnuson Moss Warranty Act prohibits manufacturers from threatening consumers with voided warranties if they open or inspect their equipment. This was actually a surprise for your writer that had the belief that brands were allowed to do what they’ve been doing since I can remember using electronic devices.
Although the voting did not create anything new but reinforced the existing law, it was a push in the direction for the “Right to Repair” bills produced in many States. Dealing with such laws at the State level will create havoc for manufacturers and consumers, but if the movement propagates to enough States, it will pressure the Senate to move in the same direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-right-for-insecurity&quot;&gt;The Right for Insecurity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost every brand presents a legitimate pair of cross-cutting concerns to avoid “Right to Repair” bills. Safety and security.
If we are talking about heavy equipment brands, safety is the top concern. Allowing anyone to repair equipment with blades on top of rotors makes one think of horror movies. Still, even smaller electronic pieces of equipment can cause much damage when a battery goes haywire.
Physical safety should not be taken lightly. Vetting manufacturers that build parts with high defect rates and professionals that don’t follow safety procedures should be possible while allowing good service from third-party repair shops. Also, many component replacement procedures can be safe if appropriately designed. Early generation laptops were made with replaceable batteries, but nowadays, most laptops have soldered batteries sacrificing the user need for a slick design, or so the brand says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, we should not ignore the security risk of shoddy manufacturers providing parts with firmware backdoors or ignoring safety and security concerns. Even well-known brands put out hardware that can be “bricked” with poor quality software, as we’ve recently seen with NVIDIA RTX 3090 graphic cards. An Amazon Massive Multiplayer Online game reportedly destroys said high-end cards because of a menu frame rate definition. But if even big manufacturers such as NVIDIA can’t produce hardware with safety barriers for these types of incidents, imagine what will happen when anyone can mess around with advanced electronic hardware or heavy equipment controlled by run-of-the-mill software imported from who knows where.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some high-end hardware manufacturers are actually taking steps to make hardware and software more secure for the end-user, although using it as leverage to repel the “Right to Repair” movement.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/francisco-ribeiro-3b39547/&quot;&gt;Francisco Ribeiro&lt;/a&gt;, Head of Information Security at XTX Markets, an algorithmic trading company, pointed out in a recent discussion that Apple has been introducing essential security features in their latest chips. Such features use cryptographic techniques to recognise if a particular piece of hardware is legitimate or not and could potentially “brick” your device if a malicious hardware component was detected by the security subsystem.
While some of us might think that this could be over the top security for the everyday user, I would like to introduce the results of a [recently published paper] (https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.08590).
The researchers injected a piece of malware into a neural network using “plain” steganography. The code went undetected after running anti-virus software on the whole network.
A similar concept can be extended to hardware, and security measures like the ones presented by Apple can make the difference between a safe device and a bank account being drained by a remote hacker or a broad ransomware attack because of a single unsecured equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;incomplete-bureaucracy-yet-again&quot;&gt;Incomplete bureaucracy, yet again&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers shouldn’t dismiss safety and security cross-cutting concerns even when used as a shield against third-party competition.
While opening devices for repair shops or to any consumer, it should also be required that security and safety standards be met by any hardware manufacturer, following general guidelines and hardware safety boundaries.
It would be overkill to require electronic device inspections such as those mandated by the European Union for roadworthy vehicles. But failing that, third party hardware manufacturers should be vetted by brands and excluded in case of failure to comply with minimum standards. A solution like this would still maintain much of the control that digital giants already have. Still, it would create the foundation for secure systems that we lack nowadays while allowing anyone to replace components at their will and extending device lifetimes without paying premium prices for the shortage of competition.
Considering the dangers that technology can bring and with the rapid pace of AI productisation, lawmakers should work more closely with institutions such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://futureoflife.org&quot;&gt;Future of Life Institute&lt;/a&gt; so that “small tech” can be built on top of secure grounds while catering to consumer needs and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;july-27th&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;July 27th&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within a 7 day span, we’ve seen two different companies with distinct backgrounds launching crafts that went to what we call the edge of space.
Sir Richard Branson and Mr Jefzz Bezos, plus their crews, took each the first human-crewed flight of Virgin Galactic and Blue Orizon, respectively.
The most recent flights felt short for a technologist and sci-fi fan such as your writer, compared with the moon’s heroic visits that went more than a decade before I was born.
Last year I could not avoid feeling goosebumps while watching a live stream of the first human-crewed launch from SpaceX on their way to the International Space Station.  Mr Elon Musk was already and still is far ahead of the two space newcomers, although he didn’t go all the way up yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting aside some of the worst opinions that we are seeing replicated from social media to opinion columns in reputable newspapers, this is probably the restart of the human space age, benefiting from a healthier type of competition that does not use such events to signal world supremacy nor to make war.
These companies represent peeks of human innovation in a mountainous landscape of technology. Some might find these couple of flights a heroic feat from company owners; others might feel it was a vain endeavour. I see new steps to move on with human progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wath to expect now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Virgin Galactic, I don’t expect much more than Space tourism fueling investments for more Space tourism. Sir Richard Branson took a while until getting there. The first announcement of Virgin Galactic was almost two decades ago, and the company prospects still focus on short rides to the edge of space. It almost seems the mission has ended for Virgin Galactic, and it isn’t all that bad. The Space kindle from Virgin Galactic was, and it is essential to keep ambition and competition burning. I hope that the company flourishes and improves on top of this feat recruiting champion execs with broader vision and purpose, making Virgin Galactic genuinely galactic. Right now, we’ll probably see efforts to make it a profitable venture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blue Origin has less hubris on its name but has a far ambitious project than Virgin Galactic at this moment. The company driver is tourism but with the prospect of financing new rocket technology and moon landing equipment. Blue Origin wants to bid NASA contracts side by side with SpaceX bringing welcomed private competition to a game where only States were allowed, commanding large pools of taxpayer money. But even being behind SpaceX, Mr Jeff Bezos is prepared for the long game and pushing rocket technology to its limits without being hasty in the pursuit. He does well if he keeps the focus since, with only two private companies, the is much space to grow in Space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And SpaceX? SpaceX is an article by itself that I’ll leave for another day. I cheered when Mr Bob Behnkenn and Mr Doug Hurley were safe in Space within a shiny Crew Dragon craft, occasionally tapping their tactile monitors with happy faces. It was the look and feel that I was expecting from the first spacecraft of this millennia.
We can only see success for SpaceX for the next few years and with the hope of seeing something that I miss by a decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m seeing embers growing in the kindling with the anticipation of still being here when the beginning of a Space Age bursts.&lt;/p&gt;

        	&lt;img src=&quot;https://directionwithintent.com/images/Banner_MVJournal_banner_10.png&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        	&lt;p&gt;This last couple of weeks, Github Copilot was a large chunk of every programmer’s webverse stream.
Usually, anything that comes out from Github has a vast impact factor, so the reach of Copilot posts shouldn’t be a surprise.
Github’s new feature, still in preview for selected developers, promises a small AI revolution, adding superpowers to every developer with its programmer’s intent precognition. But is it a step in the right direction?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#ai-pair-programming&quot;&gt;AI Pair Programming&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;ai-pair-programming&quot;&gt;AI Pair Programming&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;june-27th&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;June 27th&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;copy-paste-generation&quot;&gt;Copy Paste generation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivomanueljesus/&quot;&gt;Ivo Jesus&lt;/a&gt;, a freelance Software Engineer and a good friend of mine, shared this Copilot’s suggestion with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://directionwithintent.com/images/memoization.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Ruby skills aren’t up to the standards nowadays, but he helped me right away, explaining the problem with methods that return falsy values.
An inexperienced developer would accept the option without blinking to maybe discover the bug in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I remember being on the web, one could find many sites dedicated to the art of programming, with helpful tips and tricks. Sometimes just explaining programming languages features, some other times posting small but complete programs or even handy libraries to avoid reinvention.
Coderanch, Sourceforge, Stack Overflow and of course, GitHub are sources of examples and snippets for what we usually call “boilerplate code”. From setting up a pooled connection class to a Twitter client, one can find almost everything online. Prêt-à-Porter code, one might call it, can be mixed and matched, fuelling the copy-paste culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copilot almost promises a corpus of all the possible code that one might desire without abandoning the editor, finding your intention with just a method declaration. No more jumps between the browser and the current code page. Suggestions just show up without much effort. The copy-paste culture can be quickly transformed into the assisted culture.
A feature like Copilot will evidently spread like wildfire if it would be made openly available. Young developers want to learn fast while having the productivity of their seniors. Instead of time-intensive search and copy-pasting, why not just accept auto-complete suggestions from your friendly pair programmer Copilot?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the significant differences between an automatic suggestion and searching for your problem solution online is that the first can be accepted with only one point of view and no criticism. At the same time, the latter usually provides context such as the question made by a fellow developer or multiple responses explaining pros and cons about the solution that someone else offered.
Content around the code adds a learning dimension that Codepilot can’t deliver at this point. It might be the case that the developer doesn’t even understand a proposed code syntax, just like yours truly at the beginning of this section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;input-curation&quot;&gt;Input curation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copilot’s training corpus was fed without much avail to its quality from what one sees in the available examples.
&lt;a href=&quot;http://baishakhir.github.io/uploads/fse2014-lang_study.pdf&quot;&gt;A large scale study on top of Github’s Open Source Software projects, published in Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Foundations of Software Engineering&lt;/a&gt; tries to provide answers for a set of questions regarding defect density within a domain, language and language type. The paper has many insights, but one key takeaway can be inferred from the image below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://directionwithintent.com/images/defectrate.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one can see, the study took projects with a defect density between the 10 and 90 percentile. Even so, the indicator floats all over the board. Although we are looking into a study made in 2014, the probability of having a similar defect density nowadays is relatively high.
Without any code curation before feeding it to Copilot, we directly introduce a similar defect density into the new code. While it is acceptable in an alpha testing phase, taking this to a generally available product would be reckless. One hopes that before moving forward with the product, Github does a much better job with the corpus curation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;unit-testing-pretty-please&quot;&gt;Unit Testing, pretty please&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, with so many caveats when considering a ride with Copilot, where could it excel and bring great value for coders everywhere?
Tests. You might hate them or love them, but they are invaluable in many codebases, especially volatile ones.
This is definitely a domain where AI-assisted development would come in handy. Imagine writing a new public method from your favourite editor that adds auto-generated documentation for parameters and return values. Right after closing your public method, you’d get an AI-assist suggestion with a set of unit tests exploring edge and failing cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;auto-debugging&quot;&gt;Auto Debugging&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of curating for clean and correct code, which sometimes can be the source of never-ending discussion in a team of Engineers,  we made our model be trained with as many bugs as possible?
This is the proposal of some investigators in the United States of America. 
Cutting down the time that developers spend on bug fixing is every programming manager dream. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/brendan-dolan-gavitt-3b68154/&quot;&gt;Dr Dolan-Gavitt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/shashank-srikant-965aa125/&quot;&gt;Mr Shashank Srikant&lt;/a&gt; are feeding buggy code into their models that eventually pick up sections of a codebase that can become an issue in the future. If the rate of false positives is low enough to avoid the extra effort of validating such cases, we might reach a productivity increase never seen before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;laws-nuisances&quot;&gt;Law’s nuisances&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Armin Ronacher, the creator of Flask, a web framework for Pythonistas, shared a troublesome GIF in his Twitter account.
In a few seconds, he accepts all Copilot suggestions arriving at a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_inverse_square_root#Overview_of_the_code&quot;&gt;famous snippet of code&lt;/a&gt; developed for a well-known game, Quake III Arena.
To Mr Armin amazement and amusement, the code suggestions even included the original author’s comments containing some distinct, colourful language.
While we’re in the domain of code snippets, problems like this one can be averted easily and legal actions deflected, but who says that the AI engine was allowed to use those snippets as training examples? At this moment in time, this usage might probably fall into the crevasses of the current law landscape, but one should expect that developers and companies might want some compensation for providing raw digital material for an AI sausage factory or at least, some recognition whenever they allow it.
If Copilot manages to achieve success, it is expected that its suggestion sophistication becomes even bolder. Why not suggest a lightweight REST Web API with the hints from an introductory documentation comment explaining your endpoints’ purpose?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;not-new-as-always&quot;&gt;Not new, as always&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;September 2019, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/bernardo-martinez/&quot;&gt;Bernardo Martinez&lt;/a&gt;, a Software Engineer working for &lt;a href=&quot;https://cabify.com&quot;&gt;Cabify&lt;/a&gt; and ex-teammate, shared &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tabnine.com/&quot;&gt;tabnine’s website&lt;/a&gt;, featuring their brand new feature, AI completion.
Their promise was humbler but, from my point of view, much more enjoyable. Although tabnine’s code completion did not provide complete methods and code snippets, it did speed up typing for a programmer with contextual suggestions.
It is possible to see the difference after a quick look into tabnine’s site. The examples shown are pretty remarkable but don’t take my word for it. Take &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tabnine.com/pricing&quot;&gt;the free version&lt;/a&gt; for a spin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Github’s Copilot relies on the revolutionary brand new &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3-apps/&quot;&gt;GPT-3 language model&lt;/a&gt;, tabnine uses the old GPT-2 version but providing a polished product that a modern developer can rely upon. Copilot’s already shown that it’s a problem about to happen, and maybe the team needs to get back to their desks before rereleasing it publicly again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ai-is-here-to-develop&quot;&gt;AI is here to develop&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are seeing AI features being deployed in many domains. Software Engineering isn’t at the bleachers, and we are already feeling the ripples of such technologies.
Some companies boast AI similar features such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.outsystems.com/ai/&quot;&gt;Outsystems Code Assist&lt;/a&gt; within their low-code platform or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.codota.com/&quot;&gt;Codota&lt;/a&gt;, with a tabnine’s comparable proposal. We will see more promises in the next few years, and few will be impactful for sure, but I believe that a paradigm shift is still far ahead, although one that we might still see within our life span. With that in mind, maybe we should start welcoming our future AI overlo… developers.&lt;/p&gt;

        	&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, one of the biggest news of these last few weeks it’s the demise of a controversial character that kickstarted a huge company in the consumer and enterprise antivirus business, Jonh McAfee.
To balance this gloomy event, I want to introduce you to a new world of discovery. So stash your Pokemon Go for a while, and let’s help science while having fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;iNaturalist, Pokemon Go for real&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#obituary---the-rise-and-fall-of-jonh-macfee&quot;&gt;Obituary - The rise and fall of Jonh Macfee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;inaturalist-pokemon-go-for-real&quot;&gt;iNaturalist, Pokemon Go for real&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;june-27th&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;June 27th&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/&quot;&gt;The Economist&lt;/a&gt; published another instalment of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/technology-quarterly/2021-06-19&quot;&gt;Technology quarterly&lt;/a&gt;. This one focused on nature conservation, and within their article roster, one spiked my interest. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/technology-quarterly/2021/06/15/how-volunteer-observers-can-help-protect-biodiversity&quot;&gt;Crowdsourced Science&lt;/a&gt; skimmed over the amateur, and sometimes professional, animal sightseeing activities that are getting a boost from new technologies. One reference struck a cord in your author; however, it also felt too short for its value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One evening in the lovely setting of Alvito, a locality in the middle of Portuguese Alentejo, an abnormal grass movement brought to my attention a medium-sized spider for a European or a micro-scale critter using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DI9BUbsLhAg&quot;&gt;Aussie standards&lt;/a&gt;.
The unfamiliar multilegged insect was rather intriguing and mixing my curiosity with the fear of tangle with it again without noticing it, I’ve decided to take the picture below and share it on a closed Portuguese Facebook science forum.
Asking for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_the_crowd&quot;&gt;the wisdom of the crowd&lt;/a&gt;, I got some replies with the spider genus, but a fellow forum dweller, besides pointing out the species introduced me to a new world of fun. He recommended installing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inaturalist.org/&quot;&gt;iNaturalist mobile app&lt;/a&gt; and upload the foto afterwards to see if the system could pinpoint the species as well.
A few minutes later, I was publishing my first observation. I had crossed the path of a Radiated Wolf Spider. The day after, some other iNaturalist users had seen my low-quality picture and corroborated the classification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Economist piece dedicated a scanty sentence to the platform, and I could have none of that. So here are a few more details about it and an invite to join me in this beautiful modern nature conservation world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;inaturalist&quot;&gt;iNaturalist&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iNaturalist results from a collaboration between &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/about&quot;&gt;National Geographic and the California Academy of Sciences&lt;/a&gt;. It helps amateurs like me to discover nature around our own dwellings. 
With approximately 71 million observations, 340 thousand species and 4.2 million users, it is the largest online community of crowdsourced biodiversity data and keeps growing every year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your living on modern planet earth, you’ve probably got the word of Pokemon Go, a game phenomenon that exploded some years ago on all continents. The player was invited to physically move around with the game running to find  Pokemons hidden at specific geographic coordinates. The objective was to collect them and eventually battle with other Pokemon players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about doing it for real? Without the fighting, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since my first encounter with the friendly Wolf Spider, I collected a meagre 69 observations of plants, insects, birds, and reptiles, including a Cuban Ground Hutia and a Roughtail Rock Agama. 
Nowadays, I can even distinguish a Mud Dauber from a Velutina.
What are those? Well, join me, and you’ll find out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;machine-learning-animals&quot;&gt;Machine Learning Animals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The requirements to process and distil such a large amount of information aren’t simple. Even before going through the Software Engineering that allows the feat, one can imagine that Machine Learning has an integral part in their pipelines. 
The team responsible for the platform have been organizing classification competitions since 2017. They proved to be essential to the continuous development of their ML pipeline. Each year the error rate dropped, and it’s already below 10%. For a dataset comprising 2.7 million images with more than 10 thousand species, it is a remarkable result.
Unfortunately, like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix_Prize&quot;&gt;Netflix Prize&lt;/a&gt;, winning doesn’t mean feasibility, and some of the most accurate models don’t have a good fit with mobile specs, at least for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;aws-of-course&quot;&gt;AWS of course&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While looking for hints about their tech stack, I’ve tripped in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.science/research-awards/success-stories/inaturalist-cvpr-machine-learning-datasets-challenge&quot;&gt;this blog post from Amazon Science&lt;/a&gt; and discovered that iNaturalist had won a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.science/research-awards/program-updates/2019-q2-q3-aws-machine-learning-research-awards-recipients-announced&quot;&gt;AWS Machine Learning Research Award in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and guess what, they are hosted at AWS!
The prize provides unlimited funds and AWS credits to run the app on their cloud but also allows the project to provide &lt;a href=&quot;https://registry.opendata.aws/inaturalist-open-data/&quot;&gt;the data, free of charge&lt;/a&gt; for anyone that wants to play with it and prepare for the next competition. 
The dataset might prove invaluable for the next generation of researchers that can combine the expertise of the field with Machine Learning magic, identifying and tracking biodiversity all over the world.
Well, nowadays, the probability of having your infrastructure in a cloud behemoth is significant but brought another point of interest for your &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meetup.com/AWS-User-Group-Lisbon/members/?op=leaders&quot;&gt;biased writer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When writing this piece, I’m about to visit the Moorish Castle in Sintra, at the top of Sintra’s Moutain range, in the midst of the protected forest area. Let’s see what I can find today!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ps-other-great-story&quot;&gt;PS: Other Great Story&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/inaturalist-app-disconnection/&quot;&gt;Wired has a great piece about iNaturalist and Seek.&lt;/a&gt;
Hope that it inspires you to join me in this spectacular app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;obituary---the-rise-and-fall-of-jonh-macfee&quot;&gt;Obituary - The rise and fall of Jonh Macfee&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;june-25th&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;June 25th&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Near the end of the 90s, I had to face my first boot sector virus after installing a game that resided in a string of floppy disks. Fortunately, I had excellent relations with owners and employees of many computer stores in my town. A quick visit to the nearest one yielded yet another floppy disk, but this one would take the place of my hard drive before booting a Windows 95 operating system. Mr Costa, the shop owner at the time, wrote “Diskete Arranque Macfee” on the glued paper label. Translating and ignoring the typos, one would get “Macfee Boot Disk”. That was my first successful battle with a nasty set of bytes that owned my computer for an afternoon.
I had to install an antivirus into my machine in the aftermath, and the choice fell without any doubt on the ubiquitous “McAfee Antivírus”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June 23. My social feeds got inundated with the announcement that Mr John McAfee presumably ended his life in a Spanish prison where he was imprisoned since October 2020 after Spanish authorities followed a US mandate that sought Mr McAfee for tax evasion charges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-rise&quot;&gt;The rise&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After his McAfee Associates Inc. exit, a company that he founded, Mr McAfee had a ruckus of a life until his arrest. Even before becoming a millionaire, he had to overcome the tragedy of losing his father at a very young age and the end of a promising academic career due to his love for an undergrad student that eventually became his first wife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From that point on, he spent almost two decades working as a Software Developer and Designer, starting at the Missouri Pacific Railroad and ending his journey as an employee with Lockheed when the idea of developing software that could deal with the emerging threat of computer viruses that were spreading in the 80s was seeded with a copy of Brain in Mr McAfee hands. Drugs and alcohol were a constant until 83 when he declared sobriety after getting support from the AA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After digging in many articles and stories, it is hard to understand if Mr McAfee was indeed a high-quality technologist. There is evidence of some high-level work, but his social skills and some examples of his life cast doubt on his software development prowess. Nevertheless, one just requires a genius moment, the will to take the opportunity and the strength to execute. Mr McAfee demonstrated that he had it all in excess, making his vision real in the personal computer consumer market where growth could not be stopped. With some cyber viruses playing havoc with expensive computers systems, users had no choice but to find something that helped them recover a system and protect them from further infections. Mr McAfee built his company on top of that fear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The McAfee antivirus bloomed in the 90s; however, the founder already had left the building but not without making a bundle. The complete detachment happened in 94 after selling all of his shares and making his wealth well north of 100 million dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between 1994 and 2008, he kept a low social profile but with an active part in society. Thus, according to himself, maintaining his business, properties, and a low profile battle against the drugs that had plagued him.
At this time, it’s impossible to understand how much he was affected by a considerable period filled with heavy drugs and alcohol, but with examples quite close from yours truly, one can safely assume that they weren’t innocuous to an already troubled mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-fall&quot;&gt;The fall&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2008 Mr McAfee started a new period in his life after the sub-prime crises got a large chunk of his wealth and investments. Keeping a millionaire lifestyle and maintaining control of his assets became a burden that he did not want to carry. So he took himself to Belize after mopping up world-encompassing expenses while fleeing from some potential lawsuits building upon American soil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One cannot fathom what happened from this point on, but the bright businessman became eccentric, erratic and very dangerous. The best tale that I’ve found was this piece from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2012/12/ff-john-mcafees-last-stand/&quot;&gt;Wired&lt;/a&gt; with much detail about what transpired until 2012. Be warned that you’ll probably deem Mr McAfee insane after reading the article, and with good reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The troubled businessman never abandoned new ventures and kept investing and creating new companies throughout his life. He mainly was connected with the security market. However, he also dabbled in other areas, maintained an active VC profile, helping startups, and put money behind what he believed. His last investments were in the cryptocurrency world, and some were denounced as scams or pump-and-dump schemes to profit from newly minted cryptocurrencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A declared libertarian, Mr McAfee entered the presidential race in 2015 and eventually made a bid for the Libertarian Party, losing the vote in the Libertarian National Convention. He tried again in 2018, but with US authorities on his heels for tax evasion while building a periplus including Havana of all the places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end of his life in a Spanish prison wasn’t enough, and some of his associates are pinning the event to the Q conspiracies that ramped up in the last years. This further taints Mr McAfee life, and one urges the reader to ignore such nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my point of view, the narrative is straightforward and matches stereotypes that I know well. A brilliant man with the drive to change the world was also prone to fall into the excesses of life, which probably impacted his agency evermore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, I’ve learned that my “Diskete Arranque Macfee” wasn’t a part of his work but was definitely a part of his legacy. Rest in peace, Mr McAfee.&lt;/p&gt;

        	&lt;p&gt;Would you pay 3 dollars per month to get an undo feature in your favourite blogging platform? I wouldn’t, but this is what Twitter is proposing in their new tiered service, Blue. Ok, I’m ranting a bit, but there isn’t much more in Twitter’s proposition.
On the other hand, how about using volcanoes to mine Bitcoin? Intrigued? Spare a few minutes and get your curiosity satisfied in this fortnight’s MV Journal edition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#twitter-going-blue-stay-in-black&quot;&gt;Twitter - Going Blue, stay in Black&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#el-moneda-digital&quot;&gt;El Moneda Digital&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;twitter---going-blue-stay-in-black&quot;&gt;Twitter - Going Blue, stay in Black&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;june-3rd&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;June 3rd&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a technologist at heart and early adopter whenever I can, so when Twitter came about to my attention, I had to get in. The premise wasn’t strong, but users were piling up in the queue for a registration form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They called it “microblogging”. A minimal amount of characters, 140, was the limit of a “tweet”. Since my first one, I was amazed by the lengths users took to get their thoughts compressed in that tight character space. Since then, Twitter added 100 more characters to the limit and changed a few rules to avoid accounting for attached media or special characters. Twitter “@” ‘s or “handles”, which refer to unique user names, happily subject themselves to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://directionwithintent.com/product/avoiding-procrustes-bed&quot;&gt;procrustean bed&lt;/a&gt; of content by feature, and despite my beliefs that the product didn’t have a chance as a business, they still push on, 15 years later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-make-money-twitter&quot;&gt;How to make money @Twitter?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be fair, one can use Twitter only as an amplifier for full-length content.
A headline plus a link or, more recently, an integrated video can make the dues and point users to a business or content provider. This is probably the best hook for businesses paying something for the service, and it’s the most significant slice of revenue from Twitter, albeit it isn’t enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Layoffs and cutting fat down was another tool that Twitter had to use a few years after going public. The market needed a signal that Twitter wasn’t only a flashy service with a dot-com fate, and management complied, cutting &lt;a href=&quot;https://vine.co/&quot;&gt;Vine&lt;/a&gt; and trimming down the payslip sheet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;April 29th of this year, Twitter announced a profitable year with 68 million dollars resulting from the 2020 exercise. It is an impressive number for a product that reported its first profitable year in 2018. The year after, they’ve gone to red again with a loss of 8.4 million dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to make money @Twitter even when they are a source of constant social noise and publicity broadcasting from many celebrities and politicians. One should expect that publicity and promoted content could cover the expense, but as it seems, it isn’t enough. With 86% of the revenue stream &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/120114/how-does-twitter-twtr-make-money.asp&quot;&gt;coming from advertisement&lt;/a&gt;, the formula needs to change, especially when huge markets like India need constant political care has one can see by the recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/delhi-police-run-by-indias-central-government-raids-twitter-offices-over-manipulated-label/&quot;&gt;authority incursions into Delhi Twitter offices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But growing the “Data Licensing and Other” slice has been very elusive to Twitter management. &lt;a href=&quot;https://vine.co/&quot;&gt;Vine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pscp.tv/&quot;&gt;Periscope&lt;/a&gt; failed where &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/&quot;&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt; and others are reaping success. It’s not easy to pinpoint and capture a market, but Twitter’s track record shows that something has to change with the administration of new features and services.
With Twitter Spaces, the company reacted quickly to ClubHouse. The latter revealed a Blue Ocean in the social communication segment, taking advantage of worldwide Covid lockdowns that prevented more or less regular social gatherings and introducing respected speakers to the public in a friendly open discussion format. Twitter Spaces is just a clone, but with a whale behind it. The user base is already available, and it’s “just” opening the doors for the users while taking feedback and building on top. One can see the virtuous cycle or product building, but there aren’t any public plans to get revenue from the product ( Clubhouse faces the same issue ).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;going-blue&quot;&gt;Going Blue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And after many years of a “free” Twitter, management finally decided to create service tiering with &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/introducing-twitter-blue&quot;&gt;Twitter Blue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paying approximately 2.9 US dollars per month, you’ll get an &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/introducing-twitter-blue&quot;&gt;unimpressive feature set&lt;/a&gt; that includes an “undo” action within a 30-second interval if you want to review or remove your tweet and something similar to a “background theme”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to understand why users would pay for such an underwhelming feature set. Twitter is far from the customer discovery phase and has a market ripe for revenue extraction, but it still plays with the product as an early-stage startup that doesn’t know where to find customers and how to get them hooked.
It’s even harder to understand how a feature like Spaces doesn’t get any revenue stream plan and could easily be included in a Blue subscription for broadcasters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I still have my bias affecting how I see the company’s efforts, but I’m guessing that Blue will tank with the global user base while Spaces has obvious potential to grow with a solid revenue stream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One can see the failure to innovate as well. Pushing feature clones to the market as fast as possible is a pattern that Twitter also adopts to overcome the lack of new ideas. With Fleets(https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/fleets), we’ve seen the deployment of what looks like a universal pattern in social applications: posts with a deadline. As a result, Spaces was launched faster than the previous clone features, and we might see this copy/paste action repeated when a new service grabs the crowd attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a final thought, the risk of losing advertisers isn’t tiny, and I’m sure that some investors are seeing “it coming” if nothing is done to lower the percentage of the ad revenue stream.
With the last [iOS privacy update], &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; saw a sharp decline of users that share their personal information with third parties. This update will also affect some of Twitter’s targeting and within a valuable ensemble of users.
Blue is probably the result of some activist investors who don’t want to sell out and push for new solutions that spread the risk but far from a good solution. Instead, it should invigorate the investor base to find a new vision for the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;el-moneda-digital&quot;&gt;El Moneda Digital&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;june-9th&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;June 9th&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you browse the latest news from El Salvador, you’ll probably find many references to their current President, but with less than stellar opinions from the media. Central and South American politician stereotypes share many undesirable features, but “populist” will take the lead. Mr Nayib Bukele is no different. A quick search of the most relevant news at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/&quot;&gt;The Economist&lt;/a&gt; predicts a young dictator in the making. Winning the presidential election some months before celebrating his 38th anniversary, Mr Bukele is making the news this time after a bold move with a hard to avoid technology these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tying it up with our previous article, the tweet below comes directly from Mr Bukele, announcing that Bitcoin is legal tender henceforth within El Salvador borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://directionwithintent.com/images/tweetbukele.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some other countries are preparing to ignore or forbid one of the most important digital currencies globally, El Salvador made it legal and part of its economic cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One still has to expect what this means for countries that do business with this Pacific bathed paradise. Still, for a nation that sees an annual remittance of approximately 21% of the GDP, the digital currency might break many barriers for El Salvadorans that don’t have a bank account ( 70% according to Mr Bukele ) and rely on commission-hungry services that convert and send credits inbound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;El Salvador might become the first test-bed for digital currencies, and I, for one, am eager to see how foreign companies such as McDonald’s or even HSBC are going to adapt to an environment where digital currencies can be used to pay your burger or your mortgage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;power-hungry&quot;&gt;Power Hungry&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expression could be applied to Mr Bukele if one follows the media, but this isn’t what we want to talk about. Bitcoin has a heavy energetic bill, and broad estimates point to a value that goes well beyond El Salvador’s requirements. So how can El Salvador make up for Bitcoin’s energy deficit?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, using Volcano power. Yes, you read it clearly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;El Salvador already operates a geothermal facility network that extracts energy from volcanoes, pouring it into its electric grid, roughly generating 26% of the countries requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s far from existing Bitcoin global energy requirements, but the President wants to spend some of the geothermal production in mining operations and picking those elusive last millions of coins that are up for grabs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Bukele might be a mad genius who will take El Salvador to heights that the country never saw, but one needs to remain rational and see that the country’s economic path is filled with landmines, especially one that wants to strike a deal with the IMF in the short term. Fun and risky times ahead for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

        	&lt;img src=&quot;https://directionwithintent.com/images/Banner_MVJournal_banner_7.png&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        	&lt;p&gt;Last week we saw the end of the first legal battle that pitted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.epicgames.com&quot;&gt;Epic Games&lt;/a&gt; against a technology behemoth, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/home&quot;&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;/a&gt; owner wants to revolutionize how app markets work and, to that end, made a bold move against the most prominent market makers for mobile applications: Apple and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;. 
While some fight for dollars in digital markets, others try to improve the shopping experience in physical markets. At this side of the pond, a [Sensei] and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sonae.pt&quot;&gt;SONAE&lt;/a&gt; joint venture opened the first grab and go cashier-less supermarket experience in Portugal following &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;node=16008589011&quot;&gt;Amazon GO&lt;/a&gt; lead.

&lt;h5 id=&quot;may-26th&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;May 26th&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;April 2018, at the end of an informal social dinner after a well packed Lisbon AWS User Group Meetup, one of the Spain AWS presenters was checking if his Revolut credit card would be accepted by our payment terminals. My co-organizer quickly pointed out that Revolut had good service in Portugal, but he avoided using his physical credit card almost all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“How do you pay stuff and get physical money if necessary?” asked the technologist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Just using my smartphone as a QR code reader and issuing draw codes for our ATMs with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mbway.pt&quot;&gt;MBWay&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AWS technologist looked confused, but most of my fellow compatriots took the statement with a nonchalant demeanour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let me stress that our dinner friend presented bleeding-edge technology from AWS in our humble user group. This is a person that sees innovation daily, and he still looked surprised by our conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modernity usually creeps in bits. It takes a while to understand that we are immersed in its hot waters, and when we notice it, it’s already too late to get out. Portugal is one of the best places for validating new technology, and our ATM network and services are an excellent example of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months before our User Group, Amazon was debuting Go. The first cashier-less store where a client just picks what he wants and leaves the store, removing one of the most significant friction points between the customer and the brand. No more waiting for payment in the queue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May 2021, almost three years later, we’ve seen the first replica of Amazon Go, opening its doors to the public in Portugal. The partnership between &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sonae.pt&quot;&gt;SONAE&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sensei.tech&quot;&gt;Sensei&lt;/a&gt; , two Portuguese companies, brought us &lt;a href=&quot;https://labs.continente.pt&quot;&gt;Continente Labs&lt;/a&gt;. A new cashier-less supermarket store packed with bleeding-edge image tracking systems and weight sensors, picking up client actions and tallying the expense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the technology is impressive, it still has a steep bill attached to it—almost a million euros for 150 square meters that cannot be fully exploited to squeeze the investment. As in most innovations, first-comers pay the price while others will reap the benefits of a mature technology a few cycles in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be fair, this isn’t the first cashier-less store that promises no queues at the end. Another Portuguese brand already had a similar concept store with client tracking and automated payments at the exit. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pingodoce.pt/lojas/pingo-doce-go-nova&quot;&gt;Pingo Doce Lab Store&lt;/a&gt; does the same. In 2019 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jeronimomartins.com&quot;&gt;Jerónimo Martins&lt;/a&gt;, the owner of the Pingo Doce brand, opened a bigger store on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www2.novasbe.unl.pt/en/&quot;&gt;NOVA SBE&lt;/a&gt; campus with the objective of testing and developing new technologies for their brick and mortar stores. The big difference is the way that the client interacts with the products that he wants. You can’t just pick up and leave. You’ll need an NFC smartphone to read product tags and confirm their pick up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thinks how long the technology of both brands will expand to the remaining stores. Some probably will have to wait many years since a typical supermarket takes 2000 square meters. A single 150 square meter store took 20 Kilometers of cabling. Many smaller stores in large cities are the best target of an upgrade if the experience becomes successful, but the usual Portuguese supermarket will have to wait for some technology breakthroughs. From what we see, Pingo Doce’s trial wasn’t pushed to other stores, but one has to consider that between 2019 and our current day, home deliveries took the lion share of clients and brands preoccupations.
Maybe in a world with less COVID, we can see a renewed interest in physical stores and investments to improve a client shopping experience, but until we are back to fully open and restrictionless days, one cannot see such spending making sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-waiting-game&quot;&gt;The waiting game&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A European study puts supermarket queuing times in the podium of waiting with an average time of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/11474/volumes/e01/E-01&quot;&gt;20.2 minutes per shopping trip&lt;/a&gt;. In our experience, we’ve felt that the numbers are pretty generous.
Queueing theory deals with these numbers and ways of making them shorter on average. From roundabouts to the great teachings of Eliah Goldratt on how to defeat the bottleneck, we’ve played this game since the first time that a resource was busy. Wouldn’t it be nice to avoid it altogether?
Cashier-less stores are a pleasant proposition. In and out without a fuss. Go through the checkpoint and get billed at the exit avoiding human interaction with any store employee. Imagine how technology has been removing queues from your life. From bills to the lottery, skip the storefront and go online, avoiding synchronization with other humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, why not avoid going to the store altogether?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The COVID pandemic pushed retailers to deploy and improve home delivery services. With many workers furlough or working from home, waiting for grocery delivery isn’t a problem. Supermarket chains can schedule deliveries easily while shoppers are happily waiting. When businesses open again and workers are at the office, delivery hours will shorten for many. Fees will probably get higher for prime time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether we opt for home delivery or visiting a supermarket, we hope that we can forget that shopping queues ever existed in the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;market-wars-with-epic-battles&quot;&gt;Market Wars with Epic Battles&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;may-29th&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;May 29th&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is hard to negate that Apple is at the forefront of product development and innovation. Having a device from Apple is a luxury even coveted in Cuba, and having the money to buy it will probably set up back for a big part of your salary or, you probably are in a mid/top tier of wealth earners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some have the chance of holding a piece of Apple’s equipment even at the cost of a kidney, which actually happened with a Chinese citizen, others have a big purse to buy it and even spend more dollars in software.
The near-luxury status of Apple makes everything Apple-related very enticing for businesses. Wheater you are selling accessories or digital goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortnite, one of the most profitable games from Epic Games, was making a bundle selling game passes and in-app purchases such as avatar and equipment skins for almost every game platform.
While the absolute values aren’t public, some estimates point that 1.2 billion dollars flowed through Apple App Store, leaving a commission of approximately 350 million dollars. While everything was working as intended for Apple, Epic didn’t share the same opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple isn’t the only market-maker for smartphone applications, although it controls its hardware and software distribution. Google also has its Play Store, which houses a wealthy library of applications for Android. The difference between both is well-known. While Apple doesn’t allow sideloading applications nor third party markets, Google leaves some space for competition.
Nevertheless, Google’s Play Store has the most extensive footprint in the Android app market, and it isn’t hard to understand why. The brand matters, and client’s put their trust in Google’s products. On the other hand, Google doesn’t help competitors either. They actually penalize third-party stores making them hard to install or even flagging them as unsafe. &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;Aptoid&lt;/a&gt;, a Portuguese third-party app market, found it early in their business since 2014 battles with each new Android version. Mulivision’s floor neighbours can tell you a story or two about Google’s behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether in Google’s Play Store or Apples App Store, you have to pay a 30% commission, but only after making a million dollars in Apple’s case. Until then you get a discount rate of 15%. For each dollar that your app extracts from a user, 30 cents go to the market maker. Epic went with the rules initially, but eventually, the company CEO thought it was too much, although it’s a fee found in almost all gaming app markets. On one occasion, Mr Tim Sweeney, Epic’s co-founder and CEO, even suggested that an 8% fee would be enough to make Apple’s and Google’s markets profitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long story short, Epic’s CEO decided to launch a Fortnite version in both markets that sidestepped Google’s and Apple’s fees, but after a few hours, both versions were removed, with Epic being kicked from both stores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a company is very hard to take with a friendly demeanour a client’s take stating how much you should make or how much profit is fair, especially when considering non-essential digital goods. But this is precisely what Apple and Google need to defend at the court. Their profit is appropriate, and that the exclusion of third party markets in Apple’s case is for the user benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What should make us all even more confused is that Steam, Valve’s digital game store, also asks for the same fees as Google and Apple, but Epic is ok with it, probably because Fornite isn’t on their online shelves. Apple even asked for Valve’s numbers to make their case but was denied by the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to pundits and lawmakers, it’s unclear if any of Epic’s battles will win any Market war, but the probability is low. No date was set, and months will pass before any decision is made public. In between, Epic will continue to push its agenda leveraging &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56941173&quot;&gt;European Union’s decision against Apple practices within the App Store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Apple’s also took a swing at another Epic’s moneymaker, but with even more dire consequences for Epic. Epic’s iOS and macOS accounts were about to be closed after Epic’s Fortnite account was removed. One of those is responsible for maintaining the development and support of Unreal Engine. The gaming library is probably the basis for a large chunk of first-person shooter games, and Epic gets 5% royalties from big earners.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/26/21402443/epic-fortnite-apple-unreal-engine-ios-game-developers-lawsuit&quot;&gt;While Epic took a full-frontal assault at digital giants, it left a broadly exposed flank that can be exploited by its adversaries.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us wait a few months but hoping that greed doesn’t affect most developers and brands that earn their livings from these markets, and some, using endangered libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

        	&lt;p&gt;Security and privacy. If you ask individuals if they want them, they will probably say yes, but few will actively choose them, leaving the community even more exposed to be exploited by businesses and criminals. This week we take a dive into Apple privacy and government insecurity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#apple-ad-nudge&quot;&gt;Apple Ad Nudge &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#life-hacking&quot;&gt;Life Hacking &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;apple-ad-nudge&quot;&gt;Apple Ad Nudge&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2017 Mr Richard Thaler and Mr Cass Sunstein got one of those calls that you can’t miss. Well, to be accurate, Mr Thaler failed to pick up the 4:00 AM call from Sweden, and one can understand, but that is another story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prize in memory of Mr Alfred Nobel rewarded their work on a controversial theory. Nudge, which is also the name of their book about the subject, tells us, among other things, that the power of default options can be a massive driver of policymaking without compromising a citizen agency. While, in fact, we might argue that some defaults might be pernicious when the agent doesn’t know all the options, one can appreciate the benefits of good default options. Take, for instance, the organ donor option in your driver’s licence or medical id card. Inertia will regulate swats of citizens to ignore the choice, and if the default selection is “not allowed”, it is proven that a large proportion of citizens will ignore the alternative even though they might be inclined to take the altruistic choice. Switch the onus of negation to the subject, and you’ll get near the opposite result contributing positively to society in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ios-choices&quot;&gt;iOS Choices&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first time iOS users had the chance of switching their choice regarding ad targetting was in September 2016 when Apple released iOS 10. From that point on, users could mask their presence on the internet by switching a single toggle in their device settings. In December 2020, Apple stated that approximately 20% of users opted out of tracking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial Nudge here was quite clear. Ad targeting benefited the expansion of the iOS platform, especially from users who, on average, spend much more than users from other systems such as Android. And don’t forget to take into consideration the previous releases that just ignored the user preference regarding privacy. The first iPhone was launched 9 years before. Enough time to grab a significant ad market share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2019, Apple is giving signals of changes around privacy, and this is a subject that gains significant traction from several internet players. Even &lt;a href=&quot;https://directionwithintent.com/mvjournal/mvjournal_3/#a-floc-flies-under-the-radar&quot;&gt;Google saw their latest effort repelled by almost all browsers, as you’ve probably read here.&lt;/a&gt;
Although one can’t pinpoint Apple’s true rationale for the change, besides the privacy concern that is publically promoted, it is a development that matches the risk from some other Apple options in the past. For instance, dropping the headphones jack caused a considerable reaction from users and hardware vendors. Everyone agreed that it was a drastic option, even if you were keen on Bluetooth alternatives. Nevertheless, we see some years later that wireless headphones are here to stay, at least for a while, and have become widely adopted by mobile device users.
This time, it will be difficult to lead by example since the most significant competitor isn’t quite interested in taking the same route. Android, being part of Alphabet, will probably avoid berating Google’s ad business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of today, 4% of users opted in with the new ad tracking option when the estimates pointed to 10 to 15% adoption, which was already alarming numbers for advertisers. But using the word advertisers dilutes the most significant players that are worrying about this option and leading the pack we have nonetheless than Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It isn’t clear if most Facebook users understand that they are an asset to ad-hungry companies. Whether we are talking about Instagram or Facebook, publicity is the most significant income slice for the company and losing big spenders will impact their value proposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can speculate that mitigation strategies are already in place by many ad specialists, but Apple claims that it will penalize app developers that try to infringe user privacy options. We can take this as a serious warning since Netflix and Fortnite precedents are still vivid, and in the case of Epic Games, Fortnite’s owner, it is still up for deliberation in American courts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe that the “private by default” Nudge will be adopted by many businesses, but the price tag might be too hefty for the end-user. Without a clear path to discriminate user preferences, digital advertising will need to start using probabilistic approaches or even the dreaded “digital prime-time” where buying the best time slots on a UTC frontier will be available to businesses with the capital for mass-market publicity, leaving small business out of user’s sights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is an extreme prediction for the ad market, but the next year will be crucial for the business. With privacy nudges everywhere, from GDPR to the end of third party cookies, it’s going to be read ocean for advertisers and a blue ocean for ad disruptors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;life-hacking&quot;&gt;Life Hacking&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Captain Crunch and Joybubbles.
It isn’t the name of a comic book nor a TV show for kids. The pair of whimsical characters go back to the early 70s when America was still at war with Vietnam. They are known to be the first hackers in the wild, taking advantage of flaws in the AT&amp;amp;T telephone network architecture to make free phone calls.
Those were simpler times, technologically speaking, and hackers (phreakers if you want to be precise), while disruptive to some entities, didn’t present a real risk for citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter the ’90s, and incidents become more severe but still without any worldwide impact. Some hacker groups can take control of bank accounts, and penetrating governmental institutions becomes a badge of honour in the community. The sequence of events brings down the powerful bureaucracy of the United States, and laws are passed to condemn agents that conquer unauthorized access to third party systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Superpower governments start to get annoyed with kids and hacker ensembles that act like they own the internet. They understand that a new battleground emerges from the globalization of technology and adjust resources to avoid being outgunned by other players. Enigma in the second world war should be an excellent example of how a clear vision of the enemy information flow can decide the victor. Cyberwarfare begins, first without real consequences, only as a spy versus spy competition, at least from the point of view of an ordinary citizen, until Stuxnet is made public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allegedly, Stuxnet was the product of a USA/Israel joint venture to stifle the atomic efforts from Iran but take this with a teaspoon of salt since nothing is confirmed and several specialists made conjectures about the topic. Nevertheless, the final product is a remarkable piece of Software with a very well-defined purpose in a narrow range of equipment. Too much of a coincidence that Iran saw their nuclear program suffer setbacks from an onslaught of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this point on, with the WWW spreading like wildfire, every computer becomes a target, and it’s not just fun and games. Some actors become political activists while others just want to create havoc. In between, criminals loot credit cards and exploit human frailties to steal money from their digital pockets. While mayhem and activism get media attention, cybercrime moves volumes of capital under authorities’ radar using ransomware software. A few variants can be found, but the modus operandi is usually the same. 
Infect the target machine via a known vector
Encrypt data or steal sensitive information.
Ask for a ransom to decrypt the target’s precious bytes or threaten them with data exposure.
Wait for donations.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://digitalguardian.com/blog/history-ransomware-attacks-biggest-and-worst-ransomware-attacks-all-time&quot;&gt;The first one that we know about was delivered by mail in standard floppy disks and with a PO box address to where targets should send the money&lt;/a&gt;. After so many Hollywood films, one can clearly point out the flaw in the plan. How to get money anonymously without leaving a trace?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combination of ransomware and the advent of cryptocurrencies took the cybercrime business to new heights. Freezing data and systems of a target using advanced cryptographic Software via the normal attack vectors is the equivalent of a pointed gun. Making the target comply with a secure money transfer requires an extra step. Provide clear instructions on how to buy a digital asset and transfer it in a safe and timely fashion to an anonymous wallet on the other side of the world or even in the office next door. That can be quickly done by attaching an extra piece of Software or just a document to help the unfortunate victim. After that, the cybercriminal just has to wait that a successful transfer is made to provide the cryptographic key in exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be a shooting game in the dark and wait for a top-up of the donation box. Automation can deal with transfer confirmation and key delivery, making time for the cybercriminal to be on top of new attack vectors or updating botnets that drag the web, fishing fresh new targets. An this might be the crux of the matter. A slice of the cybercriminals makes random attacks. A computer is a target, whether it is a bank or a hospital. Last year it was documented &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/18/world/europe/cyber-attack-germany-ransomeware-death.html&quot;&gt;the first death, suspect of a ransomware attack to a hospital&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May 7. The Colonial Pipeline in the United States, one of the most critical oil transport pipes, suffers a ransomware attack that forces management to close the fuel faucet. In a few days, after the word got public, gasoline prices start to rise, with citizens raiding gas pumps and filling every container at hand. This event took a week and a day to resolve, raising alarms everywhere in the government and the federal bureau of investigation.
DarkSide, the group of hackers who assumed the responsibility for the attack, later made statements that reveal regrets about the incident. With a half-apology, they’ve declared that targets would be scrutinized beforehand to avoid social distress. This was too little too late, of course, but at least no deaths related to the incident were tallied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concerns with this type of random attack are clear, but they raise even more issues when governments only think security threats should be fenced from governmental systems. Private endeavours are the backbone of an economy, and the dimension of some should become a governmental concern as well, speaking in terms of obliging one with the security that the state should provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But has the state the capacity of protecting systems, whether they are within the governmental sphere or not? In 2019 an ex-employee of a Kansas water supply station hacked the system and fudged with the values of some chemicals used to treat the water. The incident could have affected the water supply of thousands of citizens, causing health problems on a massive scale. Incidents with utilities are more frequent and expose vulnerabilities in old and unpatched equipment. Utilities aren’t a sexy infrastructure and an easy target for cyberwarfare. Probably we shouldn’t wait for governmental institutions that sometimes lag with technology deployment at their own sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-defend&quot;&gt;How to defend?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security should be at the forefront of software development and not as a system after-patch. Country critical systems should be isolated from the web until security is taken seriously when developing and deploying newer systems. This has a cost, of course. It will take more time and money to set up safe facilities, usually cumbersome for operations because of the security hops and checks that one has to take to manage them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Max Tegmark is one of the founders of Future of Life. An institution that tries to tackle the important technological humanity endeavours that bring immense benefits but significant risks as well. One of the foundation areas of interest is Artificial Intelligence and the safety of such systems. In a “Making Sense” conversation with Mr Sam Harris, he points out the “security first” mindset when putting humans on the moon. He states that we need to revisit and reuse the same guidelines when developing systems that can backfire, leaving humans in a dire situation.
I would argue that Mr Tegmark could expand those concerns to existing dull technology, ignored and taken for granted by all, but a pillar of the human status quo.&lt;/p&gt;

        	&lt;img src=&quot;https://directionwithintent.com/images/Banner_MVJournal_banner_5.png&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        	&lt;p&gt;This week it is all about scandals!
We start with the last update from Basecamp, and it seems that everybody is packing up and leaving. On the other hand, a skittish Portuguese Public institution got scared with a Facebook post and shunned the services of a great company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#waking-up-at-basecamp&quot;&gt;Waking up at Basecamp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#cloudflare-conspiracy-in-portugal&quot;&gt;Cloudflare Conspiracy in Portugal &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;waking-up-at-basecamp&quot;&gt;Waking up at Basecamp&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;may-1st&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;May 1st&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dhh&quot;&gt;Mr David Heinemeier Hansson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jasonfried&quot;&gt;Mr Jason Fried&lt;/a&gt; carved an extraordinarily successful company from the boom and bust of the dot com era.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://basecamp.com/&quot;&gt;Basecamp&lt;/a&gt;, formerly registered as 37Signals, was founded in 1999 as the typical digital agency focused on the shiny web world that was about to burst. Nevertheless, the company survived through tough times and rebooted itself in 2004, leveraging the work of Mr David Heinemeier Hansson, or DHH as he is known on the web, that culminated in the Ruby On Rails first release. A good mix between European and American stock took the company to stardom and created a Siliconish culture that many developers sought to work for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A full remote company that opted out of the Unicorn stables and kept its core values, avoiding what the founders thought would be unsustainable growth and unreasonable demands from investors. And it worked.
Ruby On Rails became one of the most successful web development frameworks, and version 7 was about to hit the public repositories, &lt;a href=&quot;https://directionwithintent.com/mvjournal/mvjournal_3/#ruby-on-rails-7-ever-given-moment&quot;&gt;as we mentioned some weeks ago&lt;/a&gt;. 
Basecamp becomes a bastion for Open Source within the Ruby environment and sets the tone for remote work in the software development market. Along the way, they &lt;a href=&quot;https://basecamp.com/books&quot;&gt;publish several acclaimed books, one being featured in the bestseller list of the New York Times&lt;/a&gt;. The company strives to share what it takes to become another Basecamp and how to avoid the pitfalls of the startup era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software at Basecamp is opinionated. Obviously, you don’t expect that technology expresses its feelings about the way that it is used. The expression is based on how the Software was designed to steer and encourage end-users to work with it. Opinionate Software imposes work pathways and rules intending to create frictionless experiences. Ruby On Rails is a great example, and the “On Rails” part says it all. The first versions of the framework were groundbreaking. Making a web application with a LAMP stack require the developer to keep architecture traceability from the top of his head. Each iteration could yield a different way of doing things which hampers the integration of new developers of even day-to-day maintenance. Rails leverage the dynamic features of Ruby to establish a working path for every project. A developer could be utterly ignorant of business rules, but diving into a new codebase would be like a walk in the park and a very familiar one indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Company leaders and hired developers were aligned on product and software development topics which helps pushing forward Basecamp’s agenda. To work at Basecamp, you should be opinionated and with product development skills. From designers to customer support employees, Basecamp built a team that was well integrated with the culture and promoted it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without disconnecting themselves from Basecamp and Rails, Mr David Heinemeier Hansson and Mr Jason Fried become very active online, promoting their political and business views mixed with Basecamp’s company culture topics and spreading their feelings online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Apple&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://directionwithintent.com/images/dhhapple.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to Zoom&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://directionwithintent.com/images/dhhzoom.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;,there is always a target that they could point out in the Twittersphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t unusual that their employees matched their beliefs, not only strengthening their points of view but inadvertently mixing business with pleasure to a point where one can not distinguish the borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;enter-dei&quot;&gt;Enter DEI&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Jason Fried made an appearance in 2017 at an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inc.com/magazine/201709/jason-fried/2017-inc5000-diversity-in-the-workforce.html&quot;&gt;Inc’s article&lt;/a&gt; where he suggested that his company didn’t make the necessary efforts to promote a diverse environment, but the work already started, and they couldn’t wait for a transition. They need to be the drive of it.
This was a clear signal to the Diversity, Equity/Equality and, Inclusion movement.
Some years have passed since that piece was produced, and last year, a new employee took this matter with his own hands and started a DEI Council to push forward some ideas into company policies. As usual for DEI diehards, it was necessary to shovel out old skeletons and make apologies public. An old Basecamp name list was made visible to everyone at the company as an example that something must be done.
Some senior employees built a list of funny client names in their spare time as comic relief from the day-to-day business issues. Eventually, the list becomes an uncomfortable joke for some, and after a while, the jig was up.
Whether the issue was solved by the company or by the passing of time is unclear, but it served its purpose to address the alleged uninterest of the leaders in the new DEI council. Escalating small issues as the root of all evil was the first step, and this time, Mr David and Mr Jason thought that it was time to intervene.
While their intervention assumed the blame of a name list that was fundamentally wrong in MR David’s view, it wasn’t something that should be blown out of proportion and dismissed the issue with some rationality. The reaction was building up within company borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After taking his own time and a few weeks later, Mr Jason published a new company policy that “societal and political discussions” were banned from their office place, meaning, their Basecamp software instance.
After coming down to this point in the article, the reader might already see what happens when trying to stifle opinion in an opinionated company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first backlash was internal and brute to the point of trying to get action from HR against company founders.
Doubling down on the new policy, Mr David took a huge management decision and offered severance packages to everyone that didn’t agree with the status quo from now on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below you can find a list of tweets from multiple Basecamp ex-employees when writing this piece. More or less, a third of the company left Basecamp, but the problem goes beyond virtual walls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/zachwaugh/status/1388190748189802501?s=12&quot;&gt;Zach Waugh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/georgeclaghorn/status/1388131009531719680?s=12&quot;&gt;George Claghorn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kaspth/status/1380616358266871810?s=20&quot;&gt;Kasper Timm Hansen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dylanginsburg/status/1388199059983413257?s=20&quot;&gt;Dylan Ginsburg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… and many more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the names are active contributors to Rails and Ruby. They influence the development community. Although it’s straightforward for a company like Basecamp to replenish its human resources, it’s tough to recoup the social capital built on top of the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next weeks are crucial for Ruby on Rails and Basecamp, and it would be unfortunate if this event accelerated the graph that &lt;a href=&quot;https://directionwithintent.com/mvjournal/mvjournal_3/#ruby-on-rails-7-ever-given-moment&quot;&gt;we’ve featured in a past article&lt;/a&gt;. Ruby on Rails and the Ruby community still have a lot to pour down into the technology zeitgeist, and it would be a shame to see that a minor or unexisting DEI issue might affect the tech community cohesion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;cloudflare-conspiracy-in-portugal&quot;&gt;Cloudflare Conspiracy in Portugal&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;april-29th&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;April 29th&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do know that Portugal is a drop of water in the technology ocean. Featuring a few Unicorns in our borders is a proud thing to have, but we shouldn’t be fooled by the reach of technology prowess.
Trusting in well-established companies with a proven track record is a good rule of thumb, and when the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ine.pt/xportal/xmain?xpgid=ine_main&amp;amp;xpid=INE&quot;&gt;National Statistics Institute&lt;/a&gt; hired &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudflare.com/&quot;&gt;Cloudflare&lt;/a&gt; to help with the security and availability of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://censos2021.ine.pt/&quot;&gt;Portuguese Census site&lt;/a&gt; they were making a good choice, one thinks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cloudflare-even-in-portugal&quot;&gt;Cloudflare, even in Portugal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;November 4 2020, Mr Matthew Prince made a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/eastdakota/status/1323947883201142786?lang=en&quot;&gt;poignant tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://directionwithintent.com/images/mattprincetweet.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tagging the Portuguese Prime Minister and Mr Paddy Cosgrave. Mr Matthew is the co-founder and CEO of a well-known company, Cloudflare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems that the Portuguese Government wasn’t following through with some promises that it made to bring tech talent to Portugal.
It remains unclear if this was simply an American entrepreneur having a taste of Portuguese bureaucratic inefficiencies or if we saw backstage promises that couldn’t be fulfilled. The aftermath of the social exposure was dealt with behind doors, and nothing was spoken publicly afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward six months and Cloudflare is hiring heavily for Lisbon. At the time of writing this piece, we saw seventy positions available. This is a significant investment in the Portuguese technology environment and brings a small country closer to companies with a planetary scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cloudflare-why-not&quot;&gt;Cloudflare. Why not?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking the previous segment into our attention is essential to consider NEI’s option. Cloudflare isn’t only a big company that could provide good service to NEI. It is also an important company to retain and bring talent from the tech world. We can’t tell for sure that the decision was taken with political backstage action, but even if it wasn’t, it was a good option for the services that NEI’s required and for the Portuguese partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-conspiracy&quot;&gt;The conspiracy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we can see with more frequency, conspiracies and false news spread like wildfire. A single Facebook post that we aren’t linking here to avoid distributing even more bad content of this type was replicated and explored by several actors. Portuguese Census data was being transferred and stored outside national borders.
If this was true, it was a big slipup of the Portuguese Government and a clear violation of the European GDPR.
NEI’s reaction to the conspiracy was to end Cloudflare’s contract even after both explaining publicly that private data wasn’t stored in Cloudflare’s servers. They even pointed out that for Cloudflare services to work correctly, it is better to use edge locations instead of relocating connections to a data centre on the other side of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-technology&quot;&gt;The technology&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare’s provides services for availability and security. The idea is to provide secure links to an application and keeping it up and running even when some addresses suffer high traffic periods or direct DooS attacks.
Static assets are cached, but dynamic content is outside of Cloudflare’s control. This means that user input is also outside of Cloudflare’s services, and client servers should be responsible for persisting any user interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-law&quot;&gt;The law&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unclear at best.  In fact, there is the chance that Portuguese data flows to servers outside of national borders while in traffic. This should not be a problem for GDPR, but grey areas might squeeze some precedents if the case is taken to the courts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do hope that rationality prevails and NEI’s can reinstate their contract with Cloudflare. There isn’t any technical reason that makes this a dangerous or risky deal for Portuguese data. On the other hand, we are still in murky GDPR waters, and we could get a hand slap from Brussels bureaucrats nonetheless. If that happened, it would break the trust with a great company that opted to invest in a country in dire need of foreign capital.&lt;/p&gt;

        	&lt;img src=&quot;https://directionwithintent.com/images/Banner_MVJournal_banner_3.png&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        	&lt;p&gt;It seems that we are living through a slow world reboot. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ever_Given#2021_Suez_Canal_grounding&quot;&gt;traffic of massive boats can flow through international waters unencumbered again&lt;/a&gt;. Pharmaceutical companies trickle jabs to every nation with gradual global adoption revealing minor bugs here and there. Excluding &lt;a href=&quot;https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations&quot;&gt;early adopters that are far ahead&lt;/a&gt;, we can see a new major version of life rolling out with ease, bringing us to another edition of the MV Journal.
Yes, you are right. This is sooner than expected, but we are syncing our releases with Multivision’s newsletters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#the-old-facebook-leak-that-is-new-again&quot;&gt;The old Facebook leak that is new again&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#mv-journal-follow-up&quot;&gt;MV Journal Follow-up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-old-facebook-leak-that-is-new-again&quot;&gt;The old Facebook leak that is new again&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a frequent Facebook user, you’ve probably got the warning that some of your private data were leaked, and I’m not (only) talking about the most recent word on the grapevine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of my readers still didn’t care about social media at the time
 but Harvey Jones and José Hiram Soltren presented a &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/student-papers/fall05-papers/facebook.pdf&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; in 2005 where amongst several topics they referred the potential privacy issue with the information posted on the platform. Their work included an analysis of user posts, publicly available at the time, from more than 70K users from different schools. The information was obtained with a simple &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_scraping&quot;&gt;data scrapping script&lt;/a&gt;. To better situate the reader, we need to remember that Facebook was designed primarily for the USA’s Ivy League colleges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of years later, the company started allowing search engines to index profile pages and soon tried to monetize user information about rented Blockbuster videos. The business idea set back Mr Zuckerberg a  total of 9.5 million dollars after a class action suit that invoked the [Video Privacy Protection Act], and it was the first actual learning moment for the company. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_wants_to_be_free&quot;&gt;Information wants to be free&lt;/a&gt;, but if it isn’t yours, you should lock it up as hard as the IT allows it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2021 and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techrepublic.com/article/facebook-data-privacy-scandal-a-cheat-sheet&quot;&gt;many leaks later&lt;/a&gt;, we get another warning from almost every online tech media outlet. 533 million users got their phone numbers exposed from a breach that was allegedly reported and closed in 2019. You’ve probably “liked” a link to this report on your Facebook page.
Facebook claims that the data is old, and the attack vector is closed. The story says that someone or a group of someones exploited the phone search feature and collected the data but looking for any Facebook warning about the issue at the time yields no information. If one pushes back the search a year early, we see that Facebook dropped the feature in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Claiming that the data is old serves only as an excuse for the media. And a weak one indeed.
Facebook is a global platform. Considering the last decade of operations and counting the leaks that were made public,  it is quite possible to create rich data sets with user timelines, valuable for criminal or commercial endeavours.
We also know that Cybersecurity is a challenging topic and drives a trillion-dollar industry. Even the safest systems in the world are not impervious to data breaches, but what we usually get from platforms such as Facebook are IT blunders or plain irresponsibility with data management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-shadow-of-shadow-profiles&quot;&gt;The shadow of Shadow Profiles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This type of data breach isn’t limited to registered users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large enterprises made of multiple mergers and acquisitions eventually face the single sign-on battle. It is usual to pull user data from every information system to get a picture of the company employees and access requirements to create partial profiles to bootstrap the process.
Facebook took a similar path to build user profiles for non-users. If you recall, handy features to sync contacts from phonebooks and mail lists started showing up a decade ago in every mobile device. They allowed merging social profiles with your contacts, enabling quick access to any app using a single index that matched mail address with phone number with LinkedIn profile and with, of course, your Facebook profile.
Even if your privacy concerns keep you on the sidelines of the social media arena, you might have been leaked as well, thanks to the contacts of your closest friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;and-now-what&quot;&gt;And now what?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are still living through the legal infancy of global digital corporations. To be fair, legal systems worldwide aren’t equipped to deal with technology pace and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-46463029&quot;&gt;state legislation is flawed&lt;/a&gt; to say the least. The EU, amongst other state ensembles, are taking the first steps to penalize poor data security and management, but one cannot see systems like GDPR as a final option. It is still up to the user to take responsibility for their data and avoid oversharing. Data technology literacy needs to be taken seriously and taught to younger generations in Instagram, Snapchat and Tik Tok bubbles so that pandatum leaks don’t impact users’ and their virtual neighbour’s lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;mv-journal-follow-up&quot;&gt;MV Journal Follow-up&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last week featured a few topics worthy of mention, but I want to open up a new section on our esteemed MV Journal series.
Media is fast, too much nowadays. It burns hearts and souls with pressing topics but discards them as quickly as they are read. Retractions, corrections and follow-ups are rare to be seen, and we want to pay our dues to the latter, hoping that the first two don’t happen so soon in our publications.
So without further ado, let’s pick some of our previous posts and see what happened since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mv-journal-premiere&quot;&gt;MV Journal Premiere&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This particular edition got an update before “going to the presses” but left one point untouched.
In the piece &lt;a href=&quot;https://directionwithintent.com/mvjournal/mvjournal_1/#mr-bezos-switches-gears&quot;&gt;Mr Bezos switches gears&lt;/a&gt;, we’ve introduced the new Amazon CEO but at the expense of a vacant position in AWS. Mr Andy took the CEO baton, but there is already someone to fill in the seat.
Mr Adam Selipsky currently leads Tableau Software and will replace Mr Andy in May. He’s not an outsider. With an 11 year stint at AWS before moving to Tableau he will come with a challenge well cut for him. Bringing his deep understanding of the cloud business that propelled Tableau to a spectacular exit to the Salesforce conglomerate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;march-24th-until-april-6th&quot;&gt;March 24th until April 6th&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our last edition revealed the new user tracking agenda from Google in the piece &lt;a href=&quot;https://directionwithintent.com/mvjournal/mvjournal_3/#a-floc-flies-under-the-radar&quot;&gt;A FLoc flies under the radar&lt;/a&gt;.
After deploying their experiment, Google had to wait for the backlash, but it didn’t come from the user world.
Vivaldi, Edge, Brave and Mozilla already made their statements, and they will not fly with Google’s FLoC. At least for now.
Most of the companies showed a lack of interest or even repudiated the technology, pledging non-adoption. For now, this is great for the end-user that will get a wide array of options to cater for their privacy needs. Nevertheless, I don’t think that this is going to be the end of it. Unless browser technology keeps being subsidized by joint ventures of large tech companies, eventually the money will become an issue, and as we’ve seen, only large corporations such as Microsoft and Google can keep dollars flowing into developers hands. We are probably going to see developments in the near future so stay tuned to our releases.&lt;/p&gt;

        	&lt;img src=&quot;https://directionwithintent.com/images/Banner_MVJournal_banner_3.png&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        	&lt;p&gt;With all eyes and hearts deeply enthralled with the Ever Given fiasco and the Covid-19 season that never ends, it was hard to find those tech gems from these last two weeks. Loosen your seatbelts because this will be a slow and scenic ride, with mildly interesting facts, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#ruby-on-rails-7-ever-given-moment&quot;&gt;Ruby On Rails 7 Ever Given moment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#a-floc-flies-under-the-radar&quot;&gt;A FLoC flies under the radar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;ruby-on-rails-7-ever-given-moment&quot;&gt;Ruby On Rails 7 Ever Given moment&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The title is too obvious, but it’s hard to avoid the snafu of the moment.
Quite recently, the Ruby On Rails team announced that version 7 was bound to be released in one of the most important events of the community, &lt;a href=&quot;https://railsconf.com/&quot;&gt;RailsConf 2021&lt;/a&gt;. The conference, held since 2006, gathers a large swath of technology enthusiasts.
Unfortunately for the overall community, interest in the framework is dwindling down, but not so much that one can predict a “the end is nigh” scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;https://ssl.gstatic.com/trends_nrtr/2431_RC04/embed_loader.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt; trends.embed.renderExploreWidget(&quot;TIMESERIES&quot;, {&quot;comparisonItem&quot;:[{&quot;keyword&quot;:&quot;ruby on rails&quot;,&quot;geo&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;time&quot;:&quot;today 5-y&quot;}],&quot;category&quot;:0,&quot;property&quot;:&quot;&quot;}, {&quot;exploreQuery&quot;:&quot;date=today%205-y&amp;q=ruby%20on%20rails&quot;,&quot;guestPath&quot;:&quot;https://trends.google.com:443/trends/embed/&quot;});
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although one can see the framework popularity becoming a problem, it still musters technology giants such as Shopify, GitHub, Airbnb, VMWare, and many more. Even if no new large projects come to fruition, products and services will not evolve or maintain themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Version 7 promises much, but we’re not here to review the release. It would be best if you took a peek at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/7_0_release_notes.html&quot;&gt;release notes&lt;/a&gt; for that information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in all open source projects that depend on large communities of contributors, sometimes they rely too much on single players and put too much faith in due diligence from every project. Open Source can be unruly, even with professionals dedicating their time and resources to greater causes and community respect. The component development distributed approach spreads the work and the risk. Still, any large project should take steps to avoid crumbling when a minor project decides to pull out, even when there is a legitimate reason.
Of course, that core development of the framework isn’t significantly impacted since platform and framework developers tend to avoid external dependencies changes while meddling with lines of code at their own machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The true problem comes when the merchandise needs to be delivered to alfa and beta testers via public package repositories. Each installation pulls the latest gem or latest changes directly from the source code repository. Community testing will not find every potential bug but smoothes many rough edges that a core developer team can’t test in due time. It’s even worst when the automatic test suite doesn’t pass from continuous integration and development tools, preventing any package from even partial testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Vendorizing” might mitigate the problem, but it will not solve the puzzle. The term with unknown origin but stemming from the Ruby community refers to the technique of including stable versions of the dependencies within the source code of a project. It would help early adopters to keep testing a technology, avoiding rogue dependency changes. The process would require compiling from the source code instead of using the usual package channels. The drawbacks are obvious. At release time, core developer teams would need to check if their dependencies are still kosher while removing them from the repository before creating a new pristine package. More process and bureaucracy isn’t appealing but sometimes are required at some professional levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment of writing this piece, the release date changed to “to be announced”. Let’s hope that Ruby on Rails floats again soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;a-floc-flies-under-the-radar&quot;&gt;A FLoC flies under the radar.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ad targeting its one of the biggest business weapons in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fang-stocks-fb-amzn.asp&quot;&gt;FANG’s&lt;/a&gt; club panoply.
The Ads business per se is valued at numbers that few humans understand. Still, they are marketed to advertisers at even larger values when the Ad publisher states that it can optimise publicity investments targeting the best audience for their product or service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ad publishers and buyers primarily relied on the “third party cookie” to achieve the promised optimisation. The simple technique of saving small blocks of data in the client machine within the browser space allows for smoother web surfing when talking about first-party cookies. Still, it also opens up tracking of the user when it comes from a third-party provider. The simplest example possible can be described with the fictional visit to www.foo.com. Within www.foo.com, which leaves its first-party cookie, there is an Ad for bar.com with the right ( with the browser permission ) to drop a third party cookie. Every site with a bar.com Ad will understand where the user has been on the web from this point on. Enter Ad targeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning, third party cookies became a privacy concern, and even in the ’90s, they were considered prejudicial for the safety of the end-user. Imagine a world without HTTPS where all traffic flows open to interception.
In the last decade, we’ve seen efforts from browser brands to clean up this door, but when Ad publishers own or invest in browser development, it’s hard to understand how this would work without the force of law. In Europe, we’ve seen what that might bring. After the GDPR’s enactment, web sites decided to avoid the European customer altogether, albeit few. The majority added the mandatory form that asks the user to select which third party cookies you want to accept and their purposes. If you’re a European user, you’ve already felt the user experience degradation everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On March 30, Google flipped a switch for 0.5% of Chrome’s user base on restricted geographies. On top of the third-party cookie, Chrome will build the user FLoC ID and send it back to advertisers in the first phase of the technology with real users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FLoC stands for Federated Learning of Cohorts. Considering a low-resolution explanation, the FLoC ID will replace individual tracking with third-party cookies using group signatures. The group signature should be transient, but it will store your online behaviour in a piece of data that matches other users behaviour. A signature will fall in multiple cohorts, allowing advertisers to target groups of users with similar interests and behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is much to be said about the technology and if it really works on the user behalf, but everything points out to more significant problems with groups of users while avoiding singling out a specific user. To get a better picture, we advise a visit to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WICG/floc&quot;&gt;official repository&lt;/a&gt; and a broader analysis from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/03/googles-floc-terrible-idea&quot;&gt;Electronic Frontier Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. Although they present a dire future for the web, we want to focus on the user choice issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;an-experiment&quot;&gt;An Experiment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine that a corporation or government decides to experiment with a new way of delivering a vitamin to a broad spectrum of the population. They choose to embed it into the water distribution of some locations and see how it goes.
While some readers are already appalled with such a proposition, this is what frequently happens on the web. Vitamins aren’t a water feature, and tracking isn’t a web feature. Nevertheless, social experiments like the one that Google is doing with FLoC are a dime a dozen. After opening the FLoC feature toggle, Google gave no warning to users that are a part of the experiment.
Even using “experiment” is mainly abusing the word. It seems that FLoC will stay for some years, and we should see it as it is. A technology trial.
One might not care about tracking and even accept paying the price to avoid random Ad spam, but assuming that the software that runs on a user machine can switch behaviour without user consent is more difficult to understand.
There is a way of opting out of the experiment but at the cost of crippling existing features. The user needs to disable all third-party cookies explicitly. If your privacy concerns are serious, you’ve probably made this decision in the past, but consider users that rely on single sign-on portals and need to lose unrelated facilities to avoid experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first FLoC flight is already in the air, and time will tell if the technology stands, but users should be informed that they are part of worldwide social experiments, and be provided with a lever to exit the ride at any time.&lt;/p&gt;

        	&lt;p&gt;The second edition already? And what a couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#ovh-roof-was-on-fire-and-we-dodged-that-bullet&quot;&gt;OVH roof was on fire, and we dodged that bullet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#nfts-digital-uniqueness-paying-off&quot;&gt;NFTs Digital Uniqueness paying off&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ovh-roof-was-on-fire-and-we-dodged-that-bullet&quot;&gt;OVH roof was on fire, and we dodged that bullet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;march-13th&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;March 13th&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From time to time, I need to have a talk about backups at the office, and if you ever worked with me, you’re already familiar with the rhetorical:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;

    &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“What if our data centre burned to a crisp?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For other reasons, I also use the “What if Jonh gets hit by a car?” but I digress. Some years ago, I found out that I wasn’t that original and, this particular type of problem is already known by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor&quot;&gt;Bus Factor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;March 10th, I bet many System Administrators got immense heartburn after losing pings to their cherished machines and learning later that their data sublimed after one OVH Strasburg data centre got utterly destroyed by fire while a second one was heavily damaged in the incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://directionwithintent.com/images/tweetovh.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the fire was still running, the whole Strasburg site had to be disconnected, putting every machine offline and out of businesses reach.
You can find OVH’s statement in the following &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ovh.ie/news/press/cpl1786.fire-our-strasbourg-site&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s no secret that Multivision is an OVH client, but fortunately, we weren’t significantly affected by the incident since we only had a few development machines at that location.
We can only wish the best of luck to every business out there that might stop to a halt after this tragic incident and a speedy OVH recovery as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, even if you didn’t get affected by this accident, the event should be enough to remind us all that even the smallest business should always keep in mind the 3-2-1 backup rule:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3 data copies&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 types of storage&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 copy offsite&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nfts-digital-uniqueness-paying-off&quot;&gt;NFTs Digital Uniqueness paying off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;march-11&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;March 11&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our premiere issue, we’ve covered [Bitcoin’s value skyrocketing] (https://directionwithintent.com/mvjournal/mvjournal_1/#more-fuel-for-the-btc-fire), creating digital millionaires in a few weeks, not to mention the people that are saving valuable digital hashes for future speculative movements.
This week, we will cover another type of digital asset that is taking creators and investors attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Mike Winkelmann, also know in the digital art industry as Beeple sold one of his digital artworks for 69 million dollars with the famous auction house Christie’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;And what the proud owner got?&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This: &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlineonly.christies.com/s/first-open-beeple/beeple-b-1981-1/112924&quot;&gt;Everydays - The First 5000 days&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But make no mistake. The owner didn’t pick up a physical art piece. The lucky buyer received a data file from the transaction, notwithstanding a unique digital file minted as an NFT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://directionwithintent.com/images/tweetbeeple.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, Mr Beeple. We get the feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep up and make the best of it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;non-fungible-token--nft--a-primer&quot;&gt;Non-fungible Token ( NFT ), a primer.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;69 million dollars is a ridiculous amount of money for most mortals, but this wasn’t Mr Beeple’s first rodeo selling an NTF. A month before this record-breaking number, another original Beeple was sold for 6.6 million dollars of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum&quot;&gt;Ether&lt;/a&gt;. The piece was initially sold last year by Mr Beeple himself for the modest amount of 66.666,66 dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what’s a Non-fungible Token?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the ubiquitous Blockchain, the technology allows a user to uniquely identify a collection of bytes making him the de-facto owner of the collection and possible signed copies. Although you can create infinite copies of the same byte collection, it’s always possible to establish the provenance of such a collection and even the transactional history of the ensemble querying the underlying NFT blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the previous explanation in mind, it is easy to understand how to map this digital property set to the physical world. Assume that the author of a book only signs one hundred copies of is the first edition. A first edition might turn the printers for thousands of book copies, but only a fraction will have that valuable scribble of your favourite author.
NFTs allow for the same type of scarcity in the digital world. An entity can create a set of digitally signed copies that reside in the implementation of a Blockchain. From that point on, the copy can switch hands with a typical transaction in the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;art-but-what-else&quot;&gt;Art, but what else?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When writing this article, I explained the technology to a friend of mine in a casual conversation, which made him remember something very similar. He pointed out that the NBA was doing something similar with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbatopshot.com/&quot;&gt;Top Shot&lt;/a&gt; business. He described that collectors bought “moments” instead of physical cards, giving the impression that it was a brand approved “scam”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some light digging, I’ve found out that they are leveraging NFTs for this endeavour in a partnership between the NBA and Dapper Labs, a well-known software house that develops games using Blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My take on NFTs would be precisely this. Every collectable that we might think can be translated to this medium, but not only that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the games World of Warcraft or Fortnite, where weapons and avatars can be digitally minted. Game collectors could actually own the first sword that brought down Kel’Thuzad or a unique avatar for official competitions of a Battle Royal event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, we are still some years from having digital assets on par with physical objects, but I would not be surprised if my son’s son invests in NFT markets daily.&lt;/p&gt;

        <content type="html">
        	&lt;img src=&quot;https://directionwithintent.com/images/Banner_MVJournal_banner_1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        	&lt;p&gt;First, let me give you a warm welcome, reader. This is the first installation of the semimonthly MV Journal article series. This Direction With Intent post series is sponsored by &lt;a href=&quot;https://multivision.pt&quot;&gt;Multivision&lt;/a&gt; and will be part of the official communication for employees, clients and any stakeholder with enough patience for the author. Every couple of weeks, I’ll be writing about the tech-related news and events that sparked our interest or had a global impact on the industry, trying to make a clear divide between facts and opinion. I would also like to thank Multivision for the trust deposited on my content here at Direction With Intent. Although my opinion isn’t necessarily representative of the company and administration, it’s part of the human ensemble that constitutes the company. Every word will be written with the required respect for the reader and responsible for carrying the company brand value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cutting to the chase, here are the topics of this first issue:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#more-fuel-for-the-btc-fire&quot;&gt;More fuel for the BTC fire&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#mr-bezos-switches-gears&quot;&gt;Mr Bezos switches gears&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#media-battles-down-under&quot;&gt;Media battles Down Under&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;more-fuel-for-the-btc-fire&quot;&gt;More fuel for the BTC fire&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A decade ago, I bought my first Bitcoin. At that time, you could carry a wallet in a standard thumb drive and using a third party for storing a Bitcoin was noobish at least.
My plan was to get a few of those sweet digital hashes and go on a shopping spree in the now-deceased Silk Road dark web marketplace. I didn’t even know how much I would need for whatever illegal stuff I could buy without getting arrested for it :) but feeling like a Black Hat was a thrill.
My plan failed, and I didn’t buy anything, but some months later, I sold my last BTC for around 100€ and stating to my friends that this bubble should blow up at any moment. And I had a rationale. The protocol doesn’t scale to allow everyone to use it as a debit or credit card with a payment being processed in a matter of minutes or seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well…I made a profit, and I should be happy with that…Fun times they say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward a decade and a few “pop” false alarms later, Mr Elon Musk decides to go “all in” and buy 1.5B of Bitcoins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://directionwithintent.com/images/coinbasebtc.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing this piece, BTC rallies again for another all-time high.
Although Mr Elon isn’t the single responsible for the previous colossal increase in value, surely he had a considerable impact on the virtual currency trading exchanges making him a whale in the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only that but from now on, Tesla will accept payments in BTC. 
Yes! It seems that some Teslas will roll out from the factories after presenting some cryptographic hashes to the dealer. Fun times indeed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;update---no-mountain-is-too-high-for-bitcoin&quot;&gt;Update - No mountain is too high for Bitcoin&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this is the first MV Journal release, there is some lag between the written pieces and the date we publish them. Below we can still see that the BTC value at Coindesk is pushing the limits, and even with some less than kosher tweets from Mr Elon, one can still imagine that the rally is far from ending this soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://directionwithintent.com/images/stillrising.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mr-bezos-switches-gears&quot;&gt;Mr Bezos switches gears&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/104961749-Jeff_doordesk.png?v=1529477304&amp;amp;w=1400&amp;amp;h=950&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The year was 1994. You can see a young Jeff Bezos on top of what serves as a desk but, in reality, is a door supported by four by fours, with a metal reinforcement at the angles.
Since the beginning, Mr Bezos pushed the company with a groundhoggian philosophy of meeting every new day like day one. That also means that frugality was a keyword when considering any investment. Some decades later, many offices still sport desks made of doors as a homage to those initial years.
Nowadays, Mr Bezos leads a world conglomerate that ships almost everything you can imagine while being the IT backbone of other mega services such as Netflix and Outsystems. On the side, he still holds the Washington Post, keeping the dying business of the press very much alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move announced this week shouldn’t be a big surprise for many, although a much delayed one. Since 2016, Mr Bezos created a small circle of trusted execs to help run the empire’s day-to-day. Everyone was waiting that the CEO torch falls into their hands. Andy Jassey was the lucky one if you think that a 24/7 job with thousands of workers relying on your decisions means luck.
Mr Andy, responsible for the massive success that AWS is nowadays, will hold the keys of all Amazon aspects, from retail to the cloud. A big responsibility for sure and with challenges that Mr Bezos will happily delegate for the following years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Bezos is not going anywhere. He lifted himself to the chairman position, but the audience guess is that he’ll be there for the tough days that eventually will meet the company as he already warned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my part, I hope that his efforts focus on the space industry with Blue Origin. Mr Musk has pushed the boundaries of this endeavour, making everyone feel that he doesn’t need competition to accelerate towards the future, but this might not be the case when the business solidifies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here at Multivision, we wish well to Mr Bezos and his transition, hoping to see some of those Blue Origin ships delivering packages to Mars colonies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;media-battles-down-under&quot;&gt;Media battles Down Under&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From time to time, we see some doubtful tech legislation popping up here and there on the globe—some with good intents but usually grounding themselves on ill-informed politicians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia doesn’t fall behind, and everyone still remembers the TOLA Act, rammed into the Aussie parliament in 2018. A proposal that makes IT companies break their encryption and potentially develop security holes, well known as backdoors, 
“Let’s just make Australians safer over Christmas,” said Mr Bill Shorten, leader of the opposition at the time. It’s not a wonder that the IT sector still remains unconvinced. Just ask Atlassian for their thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time we see another controversial law, to say it at least. While it doesn’t seem as dangerous as the TOLA Act, it will significantly impact the average internet information consumer.
The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.accc.gov.au/focus-areas/digital-platforms/news-media-bargaining-code&quot;&gt;News Media Bargaining Code&lt;/a&gt; passed the Aussi parliament on 17 February. The law targets the American IT tech giants Facebook and Google, requiring public deals with media agencies to keep the ability to share and maintain links to their media outlets. This law initiative aims to rebalance the news industry, making the aforementioned content distributors liable for paying repurposed content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing this piece, the table has been set and played. Facebook left the proverbial Aussie news building while Google forged deals with the largest news providers. From now on, links to Australian news content will be “restricted” within Facebook. Take my test in the image as an example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://directionwithintent.com/images/nopes.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, you can still share your favourite Australian topics with your groups of friends on Whatsapp. Let’s see for how long.
On the other hand, and with much more at stake than Facebook, Google accepted paying up, keeping their business intact and even increasing its Google News content portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;global-shakedown-an-opinion&quot;&gt;Global shakedown, an opinion.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This decision’s ripples are already being felt in other countries, with some elected officials supporting similar initiatives at their borders. We might even see, country by country, a follow up of the same tactic, appeasing local news businesses and voters. The most significant impact will probably come from the EU, which has successfully implemented its creative taxation proposals for companies operating within the Schengen space. The most recent victim is Netflix and other services with a similar expression in the digital streaming domain. In the same political lingo, the consumer is warned that the tax protects local content production. That remains to be measured and seen, as in most cases.
The same premise applies to the new Aussie law. Nowhere is written that the funds channelled from the tech giant will be used in the news sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One should expect lawmakers to create fair conditions for the consumer and product or service provider, but in this instance, the final consumer is left out of a B2B deal, where a conglomerate of businesses says that another company is using their product or service without their consent. In fact, the product or service is massaged to be relevant in the content providers’ rankings that benefit from the shakedown. It’s served in the businesses on volition, using less than kosher tactics to make them the top of the search or the most shared article of the hour. Instead of paying for the dissemination service, it is the other way around. The dissemination service pays for the privilege of providing content shards and referral traffic to the source.
While it can be said that Google will also use the full content within one of its products, Facebook will create a social sharing black hole for the current Australian affairs. Independent and amateur content creators and providers will fill in space without asking for money in return. If one of the final objectives is to protect the consumer from false or biased content, the effect will be precisely the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the TOLA act, we see that the Australian government needs support from the new generations that understand the integrated tech world. Not entirely, but better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;update---facebook-falls-in-line&quot;&gt;Update - Facebook falls in line.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After showing a hard hand, Facebook nevertheless adjusted to the regulation. To be fair, Facebook’s action triggered the Australian parliament to revise some of the law’s most draconian options. One of the most important ones allows for a quick Facebook escape button. The platform will reserve the right to block any disputed content that doesn’t fall in its negotiation perimeter and avoid getting caught with its back against the wall of a forced business.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>On Alarm Dumb Numbness - A Primer</title>

        	&lt;img src=&quot;https://directionwithintent.com/images/lanl-rods-too-close.png&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        	&lt;p&gt;If you’re like most of the human workforce on this planet, you have to wake almost every day at a specific time, adhering to a more or less well-defined schedule. To help you with that particular event of the day, you’ll probably recruit the help of an “alarm clock” to keep you aligned with your job time tables and to avoid a wrong turn on your employment status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When your “alarm clock” blares in the morning, you have a few options to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izWCU4Y61o4&quot;&gt;deal with it&lt;/a&gt;, but the end game is quite clear. Get up and take some action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a clear objective for this “alarm”. Stop your sleeping cycle. And usually, it is successful. Your senses can’t avoid it if configured adequately in terms of sound/vibration unless you’re affected by some ailment that makes you unconscious or insensitive. The reaction time may vary, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is probably the most common artificial “alarm” of the modern world, but this isn’t an alarm (hence the double commas around the alarm word) no matter what they say. Bear with me, please.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s the most trivial alarm that a human being can get without any artificial supplement?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Queue jeopardy think music.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, that’s right.
Pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get your hand to close off a flame, and your sensory receptors will send a loud and clear message straight to your brain, making a roundabout in your spinal cord, and back again for that burn familiar feeling.
This is the most basic alarm that a human can get. Many abnormal external stimuli that put you in danger or directly violate your body integrity, assuming that you don’t have any health condition preventing you from sensing them, will generate an almost instantaneous alarm forcing you to retreat from the pain source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without boring you much more on the primer, from my examples, we can extract two types of event that require an alert system, but only one of those is an alarm. In one situation, an external alert is necessary for some action to be taken. The second one refers to an abnormal event that triggers an internal alarm when a boundary is about to be violated or already was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before going further, it is important to distinguish both since they get confused in the day to day lingo. On System Design and Engineering, the conversation needs to be clear and concise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the “On Alarm Dum Numbness” series of posts, I’m going to delve into alarm management, hopefully, providing a thought structure that can make you avoid some of my past mistakes when designing alarm systems, or to be more precise, ad hoc sets of alerts and alarms that eventually fail to serve their purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

        	&lt;p&gt;After a few projects and some nasty burns, eventually, any engineer understands that the code doesn’t care. It will compile, or it will be interpreted, it will run, and it will fail or succeed, but in the end, it will not care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been out and about in the community, you’ll probably read or listen something along the lines:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/g/mailing.freebsd.hackers/c/DylcvbPzW5g?pli=1&quot;&gt;“It is not X programming language job to stop you from shooting your foot. If you so choose to do so, then it is X programming language job to deliver Mr Bullet to Mr Foot in the most efficient way it knows.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Code will do what is programmed to do, but it really doesn’t care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, when your sprinkle your company name, that you value so much, on variables, classes, components, agents and even on your bare metal machines (Use the Cloud Luke), code still doesn’t care. It will not read clearer, run faster nor debug quicker even if you try to dress it with your company colours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And up to this point, you think that I’m right but not adding much. You do know that code doesn’t care and singularity is far ahead. So why should you bother with names…and why this rambling?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I’ll end it with a word: Rebranding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drop’s the mic and leaves the building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;You can find Terry Lambert’s original quote within the linked thread. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>On Diderot's Effect Applications</title>
        <link href="https://directionwithintent.com/product/on-diderots-effect-applications/"/>

        	&lt;img src=&quot;https://directionwithintent.com/images/luxury_living_room_300x300.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        	&lt;p&gt;The Diderot Effect is an application of belief reinforcement on a self-identity stereotype within the context of consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now take a breather. Too much content in a few words, for sure. Let’s unpack this before going further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-walkthrough&quot;&gt;A walkthrough&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1988, McCracken ( what a name ), Grant David, from Illinois University, inspired by one of Diderot’s essays, coined the term while drilling down some of the aspects of a consumeristic society in his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/199188.Culture_and_Consumption&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;.
The effect is based on the story written by the French philosopher Denis Diderot, where he explains that the mere appropriation of an exquisite gown was the seed for a spending frenzy in luxurious items for his house. The sentiment that took him to disperse his modest fortune in those items gained momentum each time that a new piece was introduced. Later in a cathartic exercise, he spilt all of his feelings on paper, more as an act of punishment than an artistic creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From McCracken ( the name! ) analysis, he distils the Diderot unit as an ensemble of products where the consumer maps his self-identity into. He also notes that the transition from a Diderot unit to another one doesn’t come easy. There is significant surface tension before a person dives into another spending spree since it correlates with the consumer accepting a change in his self-identity.
When was the last time that you’ve changed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will not go into detail about McCracken’s (I did mention that this name is awesome right?) work, but I will inspect the effect, explore some of its characteristics and try to devise strategies that a Product Manager might employ, increasing his chances of success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating a spiral of consumption in a wide variety of products isn’t something easy to achieve. However, we can find instances of the effect with relative ease in our social circles if not in one’s own life.
Take adult (and sometimes the odder young-adult) nostalgia that makes us crave for familiar feelings from a fuzzy past, but without the constraints of that era of course. Creating a retro-looking house that hides modernity behind the design is a way of reinforcing that sentiment that we were meant to live in another era.
For example, consider &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smeg.com/&quot;&gt;Smeg&lt;/a&gt;, the Italian brand of vintage-looking kitchen appliances. Buying one 50’s style toaster might be the beginning of a hefty and ever-growing credit card bill on house appliances. You might find other brands like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ziyandappliances.com/&quot;&gt;Ziyanda&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kitchenaid.com/&quot;&gt;KitchenAid&lt;/a&gt; to get a matching kettle but without avoiding the bank account set back. And good luck finding original vintage items in working conditions for reasonable prices. An overview of online auctions will set you straight before going into that route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But don’t think this is only a rich person’s game, a way of bankrupting the middle class or squeezing innocent French Philosophers. Many sports aficionados usually spend a considerable amount of cash on merchandise and sometimes memorabilia from his favourite team, whether the circus is football, basketball or formula 1. The subject wants to show support and love for the team as much as he wants participation in some way.
He’s a real &lt;insert sports=&quot;&quot; team=&quot;&quot; here=&quot;&quot;&gt; supporter, and it shows.&lt;/insert&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pandoraonline.pt/&quot;&gt;Pandora Jewelry&lt;/a&gt; where bracelets can be built upon affordable prices, charm by charm.
Although the brand instils the feeling that the consumer creates a unique piece that eventually might exchange hands as an heirloom, sometimes it just looks like you’re carrying a case study of the Diogenes syndrome on the wrist ( just my opinion of course ). Buying a bracelet with a charm is just the beginning of a commitment, and you’ll find a new charm for every characteristic of your being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tattoos?  I’ll stop here since you’ve already got the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, to understand the facets of this phenomenon, we need to grasp a wider frame of the aspects that influence a consumer decision to absorb a Diderot unit.
You need to understand that Diderot’s tale doesn’t start with an exquisite gown in his back. The gown was just the first step concerning the consumption phase. Before that, it began with one or more rooms already filled with the luxuries that he denounces or a fictional vision with the same features.
Well before his first purchase, or some friend offered him the gown ( there is some contention about the origin of the garment ), he already had the chance for appreciating things that would make his study a renaissance king’s room. He had an image of the place where he would like to live. An image created with intromissions on the lives of high placed ones. It could be a vague and stylized idea but enough to fill his own accommodations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here lies the first not so easy trick in a Diderot’s entrapment. The creation of an image that can be split into a puzzle for piecemeal acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://directionwithintent.com/images/stylish_ensemble_300x300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although publicity and marketing would be rare things in Diderot’s time, nowadays they are indispensable tools for most of us PMs.
Consider those innocent images of a stylish laptop on a working desk, surrounded by other good looking items that might not even be at the same technological level. That old looking leather bag? The vintage camera? The open and scribbled moleskin? You can buy all on the online store link right beside the image. Why not add to cart directly from the picture? One by one until you can reproduce the image at your own volition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another aspect of this ideal image is that it can be mixed and matched with other elements. It can become your unique image, instead of being a copy that any other consumer can get. The entrapment needs not only one view of the desired environment but a variety of elements for a wide range of collages, each one depicting the beautiful moments that the consumer will experience with a similar set of items.
The ensemble exclusivity attribute will avoid the feeling of making a collection of mass-produced items that only require perseverance and a deep enough pocket in exchange for a vulgar lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;digital-diderot&quot;&gt;Digital Diderot&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within digital worlds, we can see more and more applications of these principles to keep the user acquiring more virtual goods, coin by coin. Although we associate this behaviour to younger demographics, this is only because we are growing with the technology. I wouldn’t be surprised to see retirees with disposable income, become escapees in virtual realms for fun and glory, flashing their cyber bling, renewed at each software upgrade.
Another very appealing aspect within the digital environments is the fact that you can be much more volatile regarding the self-identity that you want to imprint on the remaining participants. Cheaper acquisitions that provide sex, ethnic or even race mutations. The liberty to move between Diderot units is much larger than in reality, which benefits not only the digital market creator but also the products created to live within that market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-long-tail-strikes-again&quot;&gt;The long tail strikes again.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the niches. Those are always a good target for the strategy. Take the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Japanese culture fans will drop their savings into remarkable pieces of serial-produced art of their favourite characters.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copy-paste my last sentence and replace Japanese culture with Marvel, DC, Star Wars, Pokemon, et al.
Some of them are authentic art collections, I’ll give you that, but it’s almost trivial to take advantage of the effect on the fans.
Royalties and deals for the copyright are expensive? You can always get creative like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.qwertee.com/&quot;&gt;Qwertee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;on-novelties&quot;&gt;On Novelties&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you only have a single product? A novelty type.
Take as an example a &lt;a href=&quot;https://gopro.com/en/us/&quot;&gt;GoPro&lt;/a&gt; camera some years ago or the latest abs machine from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.qvc.com/&quot;&gt;QVC&lt;/a&gt; as novelty examples.
Applying the effect on this type of product is a bit harder but not impossible. I’ve already provided one of the most important conditions that you need to respect. Your product needs to mingle almost seamlessly with an assorted set of products, and ideally, it should be possible to do it in different contexts. A GoPro camera is an excellent example. From competitive fishing to skydiving, the camera is the same, although the lifestyle and accessories differ. Diderot units can be very different, but the way that GoPro’s marketing campaign placed the camera in different stories making it an essential piece that increases the reward of the experience is an example to copy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://directionwithintent.com/images/school_300x300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s imagine an innovative hand sanitizer bottle. If you’re trying to appeal to parents and kids, maybe you can introduce it on a picture where the classroom material such as pens, glue, pencil and sharpener are all over the table and shared by his friends. In the mix, add a colourful hand sanitizer so that the dirty play stays on the table and doesn’t travel back on the child’s pockets to your pristine home&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, I’m creating a very speculative scenario, but the principle is that your novelty product, in this case, can be selected for the student lifestyle. It’s a valuable item that will have a positive effect on the usual ensemble of school paraphernalia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exercise can be repeated over and over for multiple scenarios and targets with the same objective. Create a picture where your product merges with the background and don’t be afraid of spreading the publicity between products. Insert your product in already existing Diderot units and take advantage of the spending momentum of the consumer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;complementary-goods-not-really&quot;&gt;Complementary Goods? Not really.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An Economist would suggest that this is a direct application of a (complementary good)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementary_good], but a more observant thinker notices that it isn’t a requirement and probably isn’t a good fit for the term.
Just as an example, consider rolling tobacco and papers. The demand for the first is highly correlated with the demand of the second, which in turn will create a price correlation as well. This is an almost perfect example of a complementary good.
While the correlation between these two products is evident, even considering fringe uses of both, a direct correlation between complex sets of products that benefit from the Diderot’s effect isn’t required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t need to create a complementary good ( and it would be harder to coordinate product requirements ), but you should compose the environment where the perceived value or even the return of investment of your product will go up when seen within a collection. And this last sentence segue to another aspect that doesn’t need to be present, but it will help for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tag-team-for-the-win&quot;&gt;Tag-team for the win&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re up to date on your pop-culture trivia, you might recognize the next one. 
Did you ever notice that charm of a staged house or indeed just a bedroom in an IKEA store?  On the set, if you inspect each item closely by itself, you start losing the interest from few of the more average things, but if you take a few steps back and see the ensemble, it appears that the whole gets an added layer of glossy veneer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The Cheerleader effect)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheerleader_effect] provides a hypothesis with a more sexual tone in the experiments which I’ve tried to avoid in my example. The effect is definitely controverse since it isn’t replicable in any conditions, but I wouldn’t discard it so soon since the result is real on some cultures and contexts.
The idea seems simple, and it’s mostly an advertising trick. Ensemble images that include your product in between some other attractive buying options will boost the subjective attractiveness index that someone attaches to it. It should be possible to exploit it with some simple A/B testing techniques, and fine-tune the index to the final consumer group.
Unmistakably, you should avoid the pitfalls of trying to mingle products for different classes of consumers. Don’t try to take pictures of your hand sanitizer in a Ferrari. Your effort to make it more appealing will be blatant and will backfire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;jumping-diderot-units&quot;&gt;Jumping Diderot Units&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To finish this analysis, there is another aspect that a product manager should understand when introducing new products that don’t shake the paradigm and are only marginal improvements of existing ones.
Considering Diderot’s tale again, one can see clearly that the gown didn’t introduce an objective improvement in the author’s life. One might argue about some minor enhancements regarding comfort but accepting the story as it is, even Diderot’s grants that his old gown was a more superior fit for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Why didn’t I keep it? It was used to me and I was used to it. It molded all the folds of my body without inhibiting it; I was picturesque and handsome. The other one is stiff, and starchy, makes me look stodgy.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the first act of change was a trigger for his final sorrow. In between, he got the room that fitted the gown. It wasn’t something new that he introduced in his environment but a change of the old for the new.
We don’t know if it was an impulse buy or even a gift, but it could be left aside and ignored so to avoid disruption in his house. He accepted the change and identified himself with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming back to our study, let us consider that your newly introduced product actually brings an objective improvement that is measurable, and you can point it out to your potential customers. Let us imagine a futuristic desk light that not only adjusts automatically to the ambient light but also follows your vision field whenever you move your head to inspect if someone is creeping beside you while you’re reading a horror story in your bedroom. It even will turn itself on and off according to your eyelid patterns. Cool hum? You see a benefit right from the start comparing it with your night lamp, but unfortunately, the design doesn’t match your old furniture style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, the consumer considers if a single appealing item, apparently useful, but not useful enough to disrupt his furniture state of affairs.
To burst the surface tension, you’ll need to appeal to the inspirational instinct of the buyer.  He needs to see the change at that moment and invest in the modernization of his environment. As I’ve mentioned earlier in the text, the luxury pieces in Diderot’s room had already been seeded by existing high society tastes. Those are the ones that you’ll need to take from the current world around you to create the most bleeding-edge image where everything around the desk light is a requirement for life itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating an inspirational context around a product is evidently tricky, and so it is that making the consumer jumping between Diderot’s unit ( in the real world where he has skin in the game ) it’s one of the most challenging manoeuvres to do when it comes to his real self-expression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summing up,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Understand that a Diderot unit needs to be seeded in the mind of the consumer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The digital selves are an excellent target for consumers since the notion of self-identity is prone to volatility. No skin in the game makes this possible.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The long tail can become a marketeer target again with this strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Novelties can take advantage of the effect as well as long as the product manager is willing to share the stage with others.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Complementary goods isn’t a good description of elements in a Diderot unit. They don’t need to be directly correlated.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Exploit the Cheerleader Effect with A/B  testing of your image ensembles.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Resistance to change is inherently human, so don’t expect to break momentum but try to use the consumer inertia in your advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Hortator, an Antiquity word for the modern times</title>

        	&lt;p&gt;Hortator, a Latin word meaning “one who encourages.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Header and teaser image&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; use was kindly authorized by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cngcoins.com/&quot;&gt;Classical Numismatic Group, LLC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Antiquity and until the end of the XVI century, the Galley boat dominated the Mediterranean. One of the most visible aspects of this type of boat is the parallel lines of rows on each side. Inside the Galley, you would find the manpower that pushed the behemoths between Mediterranean shores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Galley structure was diverse, but a usual architecture for large ones would put the oarsmen below the deck or below an elevated platform that supported officials and troops.
Two or more lines of men on each side, in a coordinated effort, propelled the ship with the sweat of the brow.
It was a strenuous and muscular work for sure and anyone that tried to row, even on a static one, knows that it isn’t a child’s play. Anyone that had the chance of experiencing a canoe ride, whether using a row on each side or a single one with two paddles, notices that body coordination is as essential as the strength that you put on the push of the paddle. The row should hit the water with the thinnest area possible and exit the same way. In between the surface area of the paddle should face the force of the water and push it behind.
Not an easy skill for a  single rower. Now multiply that by 10, 30 or even 170 like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trireme&quot;&gt;trireme&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Roman empire heyday, when their navy still meant something, (although not that much) and mainly during wartime, galley rowers were lower-ranking roman citizens, colonists and freeman. Rowing within this type of boat wasn’t a task that you could throw forced labour upon. The coordination of the job required training, discipline and equilibrium between lines. In dire times when citizens weren’t enough to fill the seats, drafting slaves would be the last option and rarely done. The oarsmen should be focused on the mission of the boat and committed with the general effort. If a large group of able men wasn’t committed to the ship’s goal and became distressed with the mission, it might mean a disaster waiting to happen.
Greeks showed the path on how to staff a Galley. Romans followed. 
But as you might imagine, even with rigorous row training, coordinate so many hands required ongoing supervision and direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Front and centre, between the two lines of men, you would find the Hortator. The maestro of oarsmen. As stated at the beginning of this piece, Hortator is a word with Latin origin, and it’s best translated as “the one who encourages”. You’ll find few references to the function and some other names such as Pausarius.  But for the intrepid Mediterraneans, it fits the job spec perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His mission was to mark the pace of the row, set direction and execute complex manoeuvres with some type of musical instrument for coordinating row stride. Greeks were known to use the flute, but there aren’t many Roman depictions of the oarsman coordination. Nevertheless, Hollywood imprinted the image of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ax7wcShvrus&quot;&gt;drummer&lt;/a&gt; marking the pace that you’ll also find corroborated by more reputable sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, it was impossible to adjust each man speed and row. Lines should be well versed in the technique and muscle trimmed for endurance. Strength equilibrium couldn’t be planned ahead by only organizing lines at the beginning of a trip. The effort of a line needed to be averaged out and the Hortator would need to understand which side to favour with slight delays between each stroke while keeping a good momentum. Understanding the levels of energy of the Galley crew was fundamental for reaching any port without exhausting the oarsman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, it is quite probable that an Hortator would find himself with a scarce view of the sea around the ship and would have to rely on the orders of the captaincy officials combined with is internal positioning ability. Even with a less protected structure were rowers and the Hortator would be exposed to open sky, his attention needed to be divided between the top brass orders, his positional awareness and the performance of the rowing crew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now imagine all of the above amid a battle.
Speed would be critical on these moments, but with short bursts at a time or else no energy would be available for close engagements after boarding enemy ships. Victory or defeat could depend on the energy reservoirs of the Galley oarsman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve bear with me up to this point, I hope you’ll also found a set of characteristics that are essential for the newcome product leads or even for intermediary leadership positions were junior management is put up to the test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The process should be as simple as a combination of sounds that mark the pace.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Technical teams on the trenches need a guiding force that can coordinate the effort consistently without adjusting each member at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moments of high speed should be in short bursts, and only when the time to market means war.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stamina and strength need to be balanced.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vison is hampered on all sides. Your internal compass is fundamental.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hortator is definitely a word that should be recycled for our modern times and a title befitting to the successful leader that strives right where the action takes place.&lt;/p&gt;

        	&lt;img src=&quot;https://directionwithintent.com/images/model_T_1909_feature_1600x1012.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        	&lt;p&gt;“If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Henry Ford ( not really )&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From time to time you’ll ear this one (or a variant of) in a discussion for some in-house innovation project that requires guidance whether from the armchair or crowd. It poses as the checkmate move from the belief side of the argument, uttered by a product executive, manager and defended by those without the decision responsibility, where the hubris is strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forget the sentence’s author and focus on the argument itself ( it’s always the best option ).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it really possible to create something amazing for your potential users that could be a paradigm shift on solving one or even more of their problems and doesn’t require any input from any prospect? Or maybe something more humble but still a change for the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final user priors aren’t a requirement to build a successful product. Examples of ideas from the ether abound, and it will not be hard to find grand narratives of individualistic creativity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, the idea fails fast. This is a good scenario for everyone but don’t think that it is over yet. “I’m just ahead of time” and “just you wait and
see” will be your pause button of the discussion. “I told you so” will be the play action in a far future when something reasonably similar makes the cut. Authorities will excuse themselves of failure using this rhetoric. This one is oh so pernicious because the listener might fall for the narrative fallacy trap and start believing that the messiah is real.
In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/840.The_Design_of_Everyday_Things&quot;&gt;“The Design of Everyday Things”&lt;/a&gt; you’ll find an excellent example but I will not spoil it. Take a look and get back to me if you find it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is always a but right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For developing products, services, companies or truly world impacting ideas, that aren’t only ideology, you don’t need and you shouldn’t play probabilities from the armchair. You can eschew random choices and skew your path in the direction of the best available scenarios.
How to do it? There is enough literature to help you with that and I would add very little to it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/13348394-nuno-valente?shelf=product-syllabus&quot;&gt;My product syllabus&lt;/a&gt; reading list might be overwhelming at first but I would point as a starting point &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/762542.The_Four_Steps_to_the_Epiphany&quot;&gt;“The Four Steps to the Epiphany: Successful Strategies for Startups That Win“&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ratio of one success for each ten tries that Steve Blank mentions should be enough of a deterrent to avoid going all in with your future product. Due diligence may help avoid that one to ten and make it a miserable three in ten but surely you can see the better deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t be the victim of your belief in the survivors. Avoid the product hero who’s tunnel vision doesn’t see failure in his path. Go find your clients before they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/07/28/ford-faster-horse&quot;&gt;There is no evidence that Henry Ford said or written those words.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        	&lt;img src=&quot;https://directionwithintent.com/images/peg_1600x800.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        	&lt;p&gt;In the Greek Mythology, Procrustes posed as a gentle caretaker, offered accommodation to any passing traveller. After an invitation for a satisfying meal, he provided a good night’s rest in his exceptional bed. Procrustes described it as having the unique property that its length exactly matched whomsoever lay down upon it. What Procrustes didn’t volunteer was the method by which this “one-size-fits-all” was achieved, namely as soon as the guest lay down Procrustes went to work upon him, stretching him on the rack if he was too short for the bed and chopping off his legs if he was too long. (Adapted from Procrustes — MythWeb (http://www.mythweb.com/teachers/why/basics/procrustes.html))&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a Product Management position, one can imagine the many procrustean beds that are built for the private residents, i.e., engineering, quality assurance, operations, sales, etc. or for the passing traveller such as prospect trials, consultants, brokers and, existing clients. Let us refer to them as internal if they are to be fitted for in-house stakeholders, or external if they “accommodate” visitors that aren’t part of the company inner circle.
In this series, I’m going to focus on the external ones and mostly derived from my experience in B2B environments. The ones that may hinder revenue goals directly and create friction in the overall evolution of the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prospect client’s trial is a moment of utmost importance and, especially when a product or service has a broad and/or complex feature base. It doesn’t stand for itself. It needs an attentive caretaker that invites the freshly arrived visitor to have the best possible experience and, that can steer him on how to take advantage of the available amenities. Eager as we are, to make an excellent first impression and, to close the deal in the shortest amount of time ( because trials always have a cost ) we invite the user to feel at ease and at the same time we push him to experiment our star features. With the least amount of effort, we show him how to achieve our product promised outcomes. While the caretaker and the user roam around, showcasing the product end to end and iterating over the feature spectrum, we fall into the mistake of force fitting the client to the feature, whether the use case applies or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it should be expected of a product team, we want and need to be creative. We seek inspiration in every problem that we face but sometimes, repeating empty metaphors such as “thinking outside the box”. And regrettably, we try to find solutions on the spot, for the prospect client workflows, habits and, tools, that are allegedly defective, unorganised, inexistent, &lt;insert another=&quot;&quot; problem=&quot;&quot; here=&quot;&quot;&gt;. On the other hand, a small void or even a domain that we’ve managed to exclude from our road-map can bring havoc when a client merely hints the fact of nonexistent work in that regard. Instead, we should take our notes and seclude our selfs, for a moment, where we can summon our creativity and muster our planning abilities towards a well-designed solution. On the spot, thinking and instant client fitting is the moments where we start amputating the prospect expectations and with the best of intentions in mind but ignoring the prospect client true needs and creating product fragilities. Doing this we fall into an uberous mind trap. Let’s delve into one type of this situations. The dreadful and pernicious Workaround.&lt;/insert&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Workaround&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a well-known term in the Engineering class and many times used ad nauseam. Whether it is the best option at a time of need, laziness, schedule compression, damage control or just a temporary patch. It is a well-known term in the engineering class and many times used ad nauseam. Whether it is the best option at a time of need, laziness, schedule compression, damage control or just a temporary patch. A seasoned Software Engineer evidently used it on several occasions and sometimes wakes a night, shivering with the memories of some that still work on a machine somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Product Development, the Workaround has a very similar set of characteristics. It is some process or small addition that will leverage an alternative pathway of one or more features to attain, what we believe to be a quick win. Sometimes with the objective of solving an unexpected user need or capricious desire. Sometimes it’s a cover up of an edge case that the product team did not address correctly or just ignored because they’ve fallen into a pseudo-statistical fallacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Workaround trigger usually occurs in a commercial or technical tour of the product. May it be a sincere question that has a genuine need behind or a more technical person that wants to show off his wits. Occasionally can be a snarky remark that may compare his current work environment or another tool that he tried recently with our own, and something is definitely missing in his eyes.
The fear and anxiety of not being able to entertain the user, makes us create a parallel thread with a request that the product team scramble the issue searching a way to meet our client expectations. It should not be a problem if at that moment a backlog entry is dutifully filled with a good picture of the issue, that popped up from the conversation, and a reasonable amount of time is taken to consider the proposition. It is a problem when we bypass our product development processes, and the proposed solution involves small feature adjustments that didn’t pass a thorough impact analysis. It is a problem when even avoiding the most minor alteration, it is the result of a collage of one or more features, or maybe, just making use of a feature quirk and painting it as a fully fledged product of human ingenuity. Unfortunately, the Workaround, most of the times results in a non-fluid and/or semi-automatic action plan, requiring the user to withstand some pain or to exert himself to do the same thing that he did or have seen in action before. At the exit of the Workaround, we claim victory if a significant amount of work that the user already does in a streamlined fashion or seen it being executed in the same way can be achieved in our product. We think that we’ve kept the user going, but we don’t see that the user is limping on its way. It may take just a small extra effort to vindicate the capabilities of our product but at the cost of an amputation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the attentive and sharp reader, another Procrustean Bed can be found A Posteriori. At the exit of the Workaround and this one with the bed and victim roles switched. This one can kill our product vision and eventually our product. Remember that for the Workaround to be put in place, some small change in our product had to be made. Even when we’ve just managed to pipeline a feature output to another as input, and with some caretaker good will. We’ve adjusted our product to fit that particular prospect or even client need at that precise moment in time without measuring the consequences of those actions. Expectations were created, and new plumbing was added disregarding our architecture, use cases and requirements. To do this, we’ve amputated, rearranged, bypassed and plug it again changing our product morphology. Again, with the best of intentions, to show how exceptional is our team and product. If we exit the Workaround multiple times, it is granted that our product will die in the bed that was made with our client’s hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Workaround is avoidable, and it should be considered an anti-pattern in product development and management. It is damaging for our client prospects, and it is deadly for our product. Take the necessary precautions when you meet with the prospect of a Workaround and make time for fixing it before the product vitality seeps out from all of those newly created ins and outs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you know more Procrustean Beds in Product Development and Management? Leave your comments and let’s have a chat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Procrustean services and products on the wild&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reading this piece one might wonder that no procrustean bed should be a success since it destroys vital parts of the client work, team, company, etc. The reality is quite different and a quick inspection of our surroundings with this thought in mind will show us that sometimes people jump into those beds and accept the punishment in exchange of some promise of greatness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter is an excellent example of a procrustean bed. In this type of services, critical mass has a bandwagon effect that, most of the users aren’t even forced to lay their content on it, while amputating themselves in colorful headlines that the arbitrary 140 character limit can contain. All of them with the fear of missing out the short exposure and afraid that they will not be a part of a vaporous and fleeting zeitgeist.&lt;/p&gt;

        	&lt;h2 id=&quot;apple-prison-more-like-apple-island&quot;&gt;Apple Prison? More like Apple Island.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four years ago, give or take a few months, I’ve changed my work and home machines to Apple systems, abandoning the mixed Windows/Linux environments that accompanied me since high school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a quick change fueled by a couple of teammates and the fact that I’ve bought an iPhone a few months earlier. All my Windows machines were dead or in need of repair, and I was just sick of the finicky Vista that was installed by default in my current machine at that time. Those were dark times for Microsoft OSs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The change was made, and some months later, I was sold entirely to Apple Software and Hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my favourite things about Apple is the seamless integration of all its products. Connecting my iPhone to my MacBook Pro and easily sync my data between devices, even though iTunes isn’t the best interface to accomplish my syncing needs. Also, the iCloud option for backing up my “mobile data” is noteworthy, although one needs to keep the data hygiene for the free tier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I’m a victim of the mid-2010 MacBook Pro, but even so, the combination of Apple software and hardware bring a level of reliability, far above average. Recently, I also boasted of my 127-day uptime to my teammates that usually restart their machines now and then. I know that any *nix user out there will claim even longer uptimes, but with a maintenance cost that I don’t want to pay every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, I own a late-2013 MacBook Pro with retina display, 512 GB SSD drive plus a DDR3 memory total of 16 Gb. Obviously, this isn’t a machine that the everyday user will take advantage of, but for an I.T. professional like me, this is undoubtedly one of the best machines that my money could buy. Add the current Apple option of upgrading OSX free from charge, and you have a system that can last for four or more years without the need for a drastic and expensive upgrade. As my fellow Software Engineers out there, I love to tinker with my hardware and software occasionally, but that’s it. My machine is to work on, and not to bring me extra work just to keep it updated and running smoothly. I have joy and fun hacking away…But I would instead not do it every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I need any piece of software for my tool belt, I just hit a few search queries, and the App Store provides. Even though I don’t actually know the people and processes that Apple uses to accept a new App in their store, I always have a sense of security of the available products. Having at least a primary barrier against mediocre software prevents the application spam that other vendors suffer from their so-called openness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And because of the above reasons and so many more, many people would say that Apple software is evil for creating a prison that they cannot leave or decorate on their terms. In my opinion, this is not really a prison, but an exotic island where I can live happily without the diseases spreading on the continent. As a bonus, I can live knowing that the environment is cared, groomed and curated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;above-and-beyond&quot;&gt;Above and beyond&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No man is an island” is a well-known quote and truth. We need to communicate and interact with others to grow, evolve, and produce something that everybody can be proud of. For this to happen, we need to leave our beautiful Island and interact with the harsh environment out there. In this area, I need to champion Google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Drive/Docs combination is fantastic, for me, my team and, several stakeholders of the projects where I’m currently committed to. The aforementioned pair brings a powerful tool to keep our product backlog stories, specs and assorted meeting minutes. Documents are edited concurrently between me (under the hat of team lead), a designer team account and a product owner. All these while ideas float around the meeting table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drive accommodates much storage giving us the sense that it is an infinite local share. I just hope that Google invests in improving Docs and Drive interfaces up to the level of most of Apple software. Now and then I need to restructure my Docs and Drive area, but the current interface surely needs refinements and a good UI/UX boost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gmail is widespread, and Inbox is a step forward in solving the current email hell. My personal mail account is Gmail, and the company where I’m currently working has Gmail from their beginnings. I can’t remember a day that Google cloud services failed and caused embarrassment on my company services and processes. Add Google Chat on the mail interface and instantly kill many unnecessary email exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So “Google” reads all my emails? No problem, my friend. If I need to pay those services only by receiving targeted publicity (in a very discrete manner), then please do. Avoid sending me those ads for car rims that I do not care and sell me the smallest pocket wallet on the market. In the middle of that insurmountable pile of data, I’m a male 25–35 years old that is a geek and sports lover. My personal data is protected by numbers that grow every day just as though a flock survives predators with sheer confusion of Agile movement and bird count.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-environment&quot;&gt;My environment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monopoly is a game that I loved to play when I was a kid and even nowadays is a well-spent night with friends, but it is very dangerous in the real world. I hope that none of these companies can achieve a market position that can dry all of their competitors completely, but right now I choose to spend some years in this lovely Apple island with a Google cloudy sky.&lt;/p&gt;
