        	&lt;p&gt;Word2Vec is dope. In short, it takes in a corpus, and churns out vectors for each of those words. What’s so special about these vectors you ask? Well, similar words are near each other. Furthermore, these vectors represent how we use the words. For example, v_man - v_woman is approximately equal to v_king - v_queen, illustrating the relationship that “man is to woman as king is to queen”. This process, in NLP voodoo, is called word embedding. &lt;/p&gt;

We will also demonstrate how easy it is to extend this platform to use the additional analytics capabilities offered by AWS. First, we will identify the genetic “variants” in an individual—what makes them unique—and then conduct a comparison of variation across a group of people.&lt;/p&gt;

        	&lt;p&gt;As developers, we are usually concerned about the development part of any application. We don’t think much about the deployment part as we consider it to be a responsibility of the SysAdmins. But many times, we don’t have a dedicated SysAdmin available, so we have to put on the SysAdmin hat and get things done. There are many options to deploy your Rails application. Today, I will cover how to deploy a Rails application to Amazon Web Services (AWS) using Capistrano.&lt;/p&gt;

        	&lt;p&gt;When it comes to relational databases, I can’t help thinking that something is missing. They’re used everywhere. There are many different databases: from the small and useful SQLite to the powerful Teradata. But, there are only a few articles that explain how a database works. You can google by yourself “how does a relational database work” to see how few results there are. Moreover, those articles are short. Now, if you look for the last trendy technologies (Big Data, NoSQL or JavaScript), you’ll find more in-depth articles explaining how they work.&lt;/p&gt;

        	&lt;p&gt;The Kaizen approach to self-improvement completely circumvents the unproductive ups and downs all too common to the quest. By breaking down big, overwhelming goals into super small, discrete pieces, Kaizen encourages action. The small successes you experience with your baby steps feed on each other and start building some momentum, which leads to taking bigger and bigger actions.&lt;/p&gt;

        	&lt;p&gt;Much of the discussion in psychology surrounding Bayesian inference focuses on priors. Should we embrace priors, or should we be skeptical? When are Bayesian methods sensitive to specification of the prior, and when do the data effectively overwhelm it? Should we use context specific prior distributions or should we use general defaults? These are all great questions and great discussions to be having.&lt;/p&gt;

        	&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly few software engineers and scientists seem to know about it, and that makes me sad because it is such a general and powerful tool for combining information in the presence of uncertainty. At times its ability to extract accurate information seems almost magical and if it sounds like I’m talking this up too much, then take a look at this previously posted video where I demonstrate a Kalman filter figuring out the orientation of a free-floating body by looking at its velocity. Totally neat!&lt;/p&gt;

        	&lt;p&gt;At the highest level of description, this book is about data mining. However, it focuses on data mining of very large amounts of data, that is, data so large it does not fit in main memory. Because of the emphasis on size, many of our examples are about the Web or data derived from the Web. Further, the book takes an algorithmic point of view: data mining is about applying algorithms to data, rather than using data to “train” a machine-learning engine of some sort.&lt;/p&gt;

The typical text on Bayesian inference involves two to three chapters on probability theory, then enters what Bayesian inference is. Unfortunately, due to mathematical intractability of most Bayesian models, the reader is only shown simple, artificial examples. This can leave the user with a so-what feeling about Bayesian inference. In fact, this was the author’s own prior opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

        	&lt;p&gt;Statistical learning refers to a set of tools for modeling and understanding complex datasets. It is a recently developed area in statistics and blends with parallel developments in computer science and, in particular, machine learning. The field encompasses many methods such as the lasso and sparse regression, classification and regression trees, and boosting and support vector machines. With the explosion of “Big Data” problems, statistical learning has become a very hot field in many scientific areas as well as marketing, finance, and other business disciplines. People with statistical learning skills are in high demand.&lt;/p&gt;

        	&lt;p&gt;After last week’s Internet Of Things hack session, I became fascinated with all the fun IoT projects and technologies there are to play with. Everything you do, requires data to go into the cloud, so I figured I’d start there. In the hack series I learned how to push data into AWS Kinesis which is amazing, however it has its disadvantages. On the flip side there is the new AWS API Gateway which I also haven’t spent much time on, so that’s a perfect thing to learn. After some tinkering, I found that while AWS API Gateway -&amp;gt; Lambda -&amp;gt; DynamoDB might sound complicated, it’s actually quite easy.&lt;/p&gt;

Also, starting with Logstash 1.5.2, it is included as one of the default plugins that are distributed with the official release.&lt;/p&gt;

        	&lt;p&gt;Over the past couple of months I’ve noticed a number of new examples of streamgraphs working their way around the web. It has prompted me to finally get around to visiting this subject because these graphs always seem to stir great debate, one which seems to perfectly encapsulate the ongoing challenges faced within the visualization field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the header link, you can find the

        	&lt;p&gt;In this post, we’ll be using the K-nearest neighbors algorithm to predict how many points NBA players scored in the 2013-2014 season. Along the way, we’ll learn about euclidean distance and figure out which NBA players are the most similar to Lebron James.&lt;/p&gt;
