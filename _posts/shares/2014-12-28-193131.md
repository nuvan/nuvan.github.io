Streams of data are becoming ubiquitous today â€“ clickstreams, log streams, event streams, and more. The need for real-time processing of high-volume data streams is pushing the limits of traditional data processing infrastructures. Building a clickstream monitoring system, for example, where data is in the form of a continuous clickstream rather than discrete data sets, requires the use of continuous processing rather than ad-hoc, one-time queries.
