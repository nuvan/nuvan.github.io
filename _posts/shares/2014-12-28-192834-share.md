It’s a funny feeling to spend nearly six years making something and then finally hold it in your hand. It’s simultaneously, “This is it!” and “Is this it?” How can it be so small when it feels like such a big piece of my life?
Most of that time, the book existed entirely on the web. It was less “book” and more “book-length manuscript that you can read with your browser”. The web site is still the book’s real home in some ways. If you want to know more about game programming and software architecture, take a look. You can read the whole thing online, for free, because I love you.
