        	&lt;p&gt;Ruby is a great language. It was designed to foster happiness and productivity in developers, all the while providing tools that are effective and yet focused on simplicity. One of the tools available to the Rubyist is the RubyGems package manager. It enables us both to include gems (i.e. packaged code) that we can reuse in our own applications and to package our own code as a gem to share with the Ruby community. We’ll be focusing on the latter in this article.&lt;/p&gt;

        	&lt;p&gt;We are happy to announce Pulsar, an open-source, real-time analytics platform and stream processing framework. Pulsar can be used to collect and process user and business events in real time, providing key insights and enabling systems to react to user activities within seconds. In addition to real-time sessionization and multi-dimensional metrics aggregation over time windows, Pulsar uses a SQL-like event processing language to offer custom stream creation through data enrichment, mutation, and filtering. Pulsar scales to a million events per second with high availability. It can be easily integrated with metrics stores like Cassandra and Druid.&lt;/p&gt;

A client asks you to put a search field somewhere, and you write some SQL along the lines of WHERE title LIKE %:query%. It’s convincing at first, but then a few days later the client calls you and claims that “search is broken!”&lt;/p&gt;

        	&lt;p&gt;Sentiment analysis is a common application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) methodologies, particularly classification, whose goal is to extract the emotional content in text. In this way, sentiment analysis can be seen as a method to quantify qualitative data with some sentiment score. While sentiment is largely subjective, sentiment quantification has enjoyed many useful implementations, such as businesses gaining understanding about consumer reactions to a product, or detecting hateful speech in online comments.&lt;/p&gt;

        	&lt;p&gt;Randomized experiments are the gold standard for understanding and quantifying causal relationships. This talk is divided into two parts corresponding to before and after the experiment is run.  In the first section, we discuss how to design and implement online experiments using PlanOut, an open-source toolkit for advanced online experimentation used at Facebook. We will show how basic “A/B tests”, within-subjects designs, as well as more sophisticated experiments can be implemented.  In the second section, we cover methods to estimate causal quantities of interest and construct appropriate confidence intervals. Particular attention will be given to scalable methods suitable for “big data”, including working with weighted data and clustered bootstrapping.&lt;/p&gt;

That post focused on the motivation, low-level examples, and implementation of the REST Proxy. In this post, I want to follow up by showing how quickly you can create a wrapper for your favorite language and use that wrapper to build applications. With the REST Proxy, you only need a couple of hours to go from zero to comprehensive Kafka support for your preferred language.&lt;/p&gt;

        	&lt;p&gt;Often while scanning a network with nmap or other similar tools, at some point a NIDS or firewall will detect and block me.  This is irritating.  I wondered, what would happen if I could route my scans/attacks through a series of proxy servers. &lt;/p&gt;

        	&lt;p&gt;Apache Kafka is a distributed, high-throughput, low-latency publish-subscribe messaging system. Since it was open-sourced in 2011, Apache Kafka has been adopted widely across the industry at web companies like LinkedIn, Netflix, and Uber, as well as traditional enterprises like Cisco and Goldman Sachs.&lt;/p&gt;

        	&lt;p&gt;But what is valuable for my customers and users? Some time ago it was much easier to decide which features should be built into the next release - the business people told us. In those days software was mainly created for use in business or science. Nowadays software has become an integrated part of everyday life for just about everybody. The question what is most valuable could be answered much easier if customers and users are part of a well-known business context. But what may be valuable to customers whom I do not even know in an unstructured and completely individualized market?&lt;/p&gt;

        	&lt;p&gt;We like showcasing practical algorithms on interesting datasets. This post is part of a series of posts that explore some algorithms by applying them on the Product Hunt dataset. Since this is the first of the series, we’ll start with how we acquired the data, and then drill down on our approach for the vote-ring problem.&lt;/p&gt;
