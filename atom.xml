        	&lt;p&gt;Statistical learning refers to a set of tools for modeling and understanding complex datasets. It is a recently developed area in statistics and blends with parallel developments in computer science and, in particular, machine learning. The field encompasses many methods such as the lasso and sparse regression, classification and regression trees, and boosting and support vector machines. With the explosion of “Big Data” problems, statistical learning has become a very hot field in many scientific areas as well as marketing, finance, and other business disciplines. People with statistical learning skills are in high demand.&lt;/p&gt;

        	&lt;p&gt;After last week’s Internet Of Things hack session, I became fascinated with all the fun IoT projects and technologies there are to play with. Everything you do, requires data to go into the cloud, so I figured I’d start there. In the hack series I learned how to push data into AWS Kinesis which is amazing, however it has its disadvantages. On the flip side there is the new AWS API Gateway which I also haven’t spent much time on, so that’s a perfect thing to learn. After some tinkering, I found that while AWS API Gateway -&amp;gt; Lambda -&amp;gt; DynamoDB might sound complicated, it’s actually quite easy.&lt;/p&gt;

        	&lt;p&gt;Ruby is a great language. It was designed to foster happiness and productivity in developers, all the while providing tools that are effective and yet focused on simplicity. One of the tools available to the Rubyist is the RubyGems package manager. It enables us both to include gems (i.e. packaged code) that we can reuse in our own applications and to package our own code as a gem to share with the Ruby community. We’ll be focusing on the latter in this article.&lt;/p&gt;

        	&lt;p&gt;We are happy to announce Pulsar, an open-source, real-time analytics platform and stream processing framework. Pulsar can be used to collect and process user and business events in real time, providing key insights and enabling systems to react to user activities within seconds. In addition to real-time sessionization and multi-dimensional metrics aggregation over time windows, Pulsar uses a SQL-like event processing language to offer custom stream creation through data enrichment, mutation, and filtering. Pulsar scales to a million events per second with high availability. It can be easily integrated with metrics stores like Cassandra and Druid.&lt;/p&gt;

        	&lt;p&gt;Sentiment analysis is a common application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) methodologies, particularly classification, whose goal is to extract the emotional content in text. In this way, sentiment analysis can be seen as a method to quantify qualitative data with some sentiment score. While sentiment is largely subjective, sentiment quantification has enjoyed many useful implementations, such as businesses gaining understanding about consumer reactions to a product, or detecting hateful speech in online comments.&lt;/p&gt;

        	&lt;p&gt;Randomized experiments are the gold standard for understanding and quantifying causal relationships. This talk is divided into two parts corresponding to before and after the experiment is run.  In the first section, we discuss how to design and implement online experiments using PlanOut, an open-source toolkit for advanced online experimentation used at Facebook. We will show how basic “A/B tests”, within-subjects designs, as well as more sophisticated experiments can be implemented.  In the second section, we cover methods to estimate causal quantities of interest and construct appropriate confidence intervals. Particular attention will be given to scalable methods suitable for “big data”, including working with weighted data and clustered bootstrapping.&lt;/p&gt;
