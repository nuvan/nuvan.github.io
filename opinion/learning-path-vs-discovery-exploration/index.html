				<p>After attending Cloudflare’s Lisbon Engineering Meetup on using the Rust programming language with Cloudflare Workers, I felt a familiar sense of FOMO. Once again, I was reminded that I knew nothing about Rust, even though I incentivised a few junior developers to explore the technology. After all, Mr Linus Torvalds is optimistic about the technology. But, as before, I relegated it to the back burner for “another time.”</p>

<p>Yesterday, I finally decided to invest a couple of hours exploring Rust — its typical toolchains, conventions, and quirks. A few years ago, my approach would have been more or less like the following description: I’d dive into Google search results, pick a random tutorial (or sometimes a book), and follow its steps. Along the way, I’d be opening countless tabs to decode syntax nuances, understand idiomatic expectations, or troubleshoot installation issues. After two hours, my “knowledge” would be a disjointed mess scattered across browser tabs, incomplete notes, and perhaps a poorly structured application that did little more than confuse me. If I were following a book, I’d have long abandoned any ambitious goals and resigned myself to completing a simple “Hello, World” CLI.</p>

<p>But the world has changed.</p>

<p>This time, I started by selecting a Rust-specialized GPT from ChatGPT’s library. Within minutes, it provided installation instructions and helped me create a basic stock-tracking application. Not long after, I ran the application — only to encounter a classic Rust moment: a thread ‘main’ panicked error. Switching to Cursor AI for debugging, I had the issue fixed in 15 minutes and was already plotting Apple’s stock closing prices and a moving average in a PNG file.</p>

<p>I went back to ChatGPT with follow-up questions. I asked it to explain the language constructs, the libraries I was using, and how to set up a debugging workflow. When I requested a LinkedList implementation, the code compiled correctly on the first attempt. In the process, I started grasping Rust’s memory model, how Box and Option work, memory allocation and deallocation, and how to better organize my code. Every step of the way, I could adjust the direction of my learning with tailored questions, building both understanding and momentum.</p>

<p>Instead of following a rigid, pre-defined path—like a YouTube tutorial or a developer blog—I designed my own learning experience. In just two hours, I reached a level of competence where I felt comfortable improving my application’s feature set. What’s more, I can continue exploring Rust on my own terms simply by directing these “tutors” toward the next set of questions I want to tackle. The sense of accomplishment was immense.</p>

<p>So, what does this mean? This workflow — excluding Cursor AI — has been my norm for over a year now, especially with languages outside my usual orbit, like Swift and Go. A decade ago, I thought access to information had already peaked. Back then, the idea of “better learning tools” simply meant more tutorials or courses.</p>

<p>Now, it’s clear that the game has changed. We’re no longer constrained to pre-packaged learning paths. Instead, we can customize our tutors, define our goals, and create meaningful outputs—all while aligning the process to our personal needs and interests.</p>

<p>The world has changed significantly. And I don’t think most of us are prepared for what that means.</p>
