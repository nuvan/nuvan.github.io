        	&lt;p&gt;So – you’ve got the hang of React, and you’ve even built a little app. But after making your app look nice, you remember that you also need to make it work. And that’s when you start searching for form libraries. First you look for tools to structure data and event flow. Then you shift focus to libraries which reduce repetition in form components. And while you’re at it, tools which validate user input would certainly help.&lt;/p&gt;

        	&lt;p&gt;“Support Vector Machine” (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm which can be used for both classification or regression challenges. However,  it is mostly used in classification problems. In this algorithm, we plot each data item as a point in n-dimensional space (where n is number of features you have) with the value of each feature being the value of a particular coordinate. Then, we perform classification by finding the hyper-plane that differentiate the two classes very well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ultimate goal of the project is to provide a complete management environment focused on compliance with the various profiles in the SCAP Security Guide Project and industry best practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though it is fully capable out of the box, the intent of SIMP is to be molded to your target environment in such a way that deviations are easily identifiable to both Operations Teams and Security Officers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this time, there are no commercial requirements for the use of SIMP outside of the purchase of Red Hat Enterprise Linux licenses as applicable.&lt;/p&gt;

        	&lt;p&gt;The buffer overflow has long been a feature of the computer security landscape. In fact the first self-propagating Internet worm—1988’s Morris Worm—used a buffer overflow in the Unix finger daemon to spread from machine to machine. Twenty-seven years later, buffer overflows remain a source of problems. Windows infamously revamped its security focus after two buffer overflow-driven exploits in the early 2000s. And just this May, a buffer overflow found in a Linux driver left (potentially) millions of home and small office routers vulnerable to attack.&lt;/p&gt;

        	&lt;p&gt;With Amazon Kinesis developers can quickly store, collate and access large, distributed data streams such as access logs, click streams and IoT data in real-time. The question then becomes, how can we access and leverage this data for use in data applications running in Amazon EMR? There are many ways to solve this problem, but the solution should be simple, fault tolerant and highly scalable. In this post I demonstrate a micro-batch system that delivers this solution by processing a simulated real-time data stream using Amazon Kinesis with Cascading on Amazon EMR. We will also join our Amazon Kinesis stream with data residing in a file in Amazon S3 and write our results to Amazon Redshift using cascading-jdbc-redshift which leverages Amazon Redshift’s COPY command.&lt;/p&gt;

        	&lt;p&gt;Word2Vec is dope. In short, it takes in a corpus, and churns out vectors for each of those words. What’s so special about these vectors you ask? Well, similar words are near each other. Furthermore, these vectors represent how we use the words. For example, v_man - v_woman is approximately equal to v_king - v_queen, illustrating the relationship that “man is to woman as king is to queen”. This process, in NLP voodoo, is called word embedding. &lt;/p&gt;

        	&lt;p&gt;As developers, we are usually concerned about the development part of any application. We don’t think much about the deployment part as we consider it to be a responsibility of the SysAdmins.
