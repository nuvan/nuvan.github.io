        	&lt;p&gt;The Diderot Effect is an application of belief reinforcement on a self-identity stereotype within the context of consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now take a breather. Too much content in a few words, for sure. Let’s unpack this before going further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-walkthrough&quot;&gt;A walkthrough&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1988, McCracken ( what a name ), Grant David, from Illinois University, inspired by one of Diderot’s essays, coined the term while drilling down some of the aspects of a consumeristic society in his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/199188.Culture_and_Consumption&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;.
The effect is based on the story written by the French philosopher Denis Diderot, where he explains that the mere appropriation of an exquisite gown was the seed for a spending frenzy in luxurious items for his house. The sentiment that took him to disperse his modest fortune in those items gained momentum each time that a new piece was introduced. Later in a cathartic exercise, he spilt all of his feelings on paper, more as an act of punishment than an artistic creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From McCracken ( the name! ) analysis, he distils the Diderot unit as an ensemble of products where the consumer maps his self-identity into. He also notes that the transition from a Diderot unit to another one doesn’t come easy. There is significant surface tension before a person dives into another spending spree since it correlates with the consumer accepting a change in his self-identity.
When was the last time that you’ve changed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will not go into detail about McCracken’s (I did mention that this name is awesome right?) work, but I will inspect the effect, explore some of its characteristics and try to devise strategies that a Product Manager might employ, increasing his chances of success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating a spiral of consumption in a wide variety of products isn’t something easy to achieve. However, we can find instances of the effect with relative ease in our social circles if not in one’s own life.
Take adult (and sometimes the odder young-adult) nostalgia that makes us crave for familiar feelings from a fuzzy past, but without the constraints of that era of course. Creating a retro-looking house that hides modernity behind the design is a way of reinforcing that sentiment that we were meant to live in another era.
For example, consider &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smeg.com/&quot;&gt;Smeg&lt;/a&gt;, the Italian brand of vintage-looking kitchen appliances. Buying one 50’s style toaster might be the beginning of a hefty and ever-growing credit card bill on house appliances. You might find other brands like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ziyandappliances.com/&quot;&gt;Ziyanda&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kitchenaid.com/&quot;&gt;KitchenAid&lt;/a&gt; to get a matching kettle but without avoiding the bank account set back. And good luck finding original vintage items in working conditions for reasonable prices. An overview of online auctions will set you straight before going into that route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But don’t think this is only a rich person’s game, a way of bankrupting the middle class or squeezing innocent French Philosophers. Many sports aficionados usually spend a considerable amount of cash on merchandise and sometimes memorabilia from his favourite team, whether the circus is football, basketball or formula 1. The subject wants to show support and love for the team as much as he wants participation in some way.
He’s a real &lt;insert sports=&quot;&quot; team=&quot;&quot; here=&quot;&quot;&gt; supporter, and it shows.&lt;/insert&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pandoraonline.pt/&quot;&gt;Pandora Jewelry&lt;/a&gt; where bracelets can be built upon affordable prices, charm by charm.
Although the brand instils the feeling that the consumer creates a unique piece that eventually might exchange hands as an heirloom, sometimes it just looks like you’re carrying a case study of the Diogenes syndrome on the wrist ( just my opinion of course ). Buying a bracelet with a charm is just the beginning of a commitment, and you’ll find a new charm for every characteristic of your being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tattoos?  I’ll stop here since you’ve already got the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, to understand the facets of this phenomenon, we need to grasp a wider frame of the aspects that influence a consumer decision to absorb a Diderot unit.
You need to understand that Diderot’s tale doesn’t start with an exquisite gown in his back. The gown was just the first step concerning the consumption phase. Before that, it began with one or more rooms already filled with the luxuries that he denounces or a fictional vision with the same features.
Well before his first purchase, or some friend offered him the gown ( there is some contention about the origin of the garment ), he already had the chance for appreciating things that would make his study a renaissance king’s room. He had an image of the place where he would like to live. An image created with intromissions on the lives of high placed ones. It could be a vague and stylized idea but enough to fill his own accommodations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here lies the first not so easy trick in a Diderot’s entrapment. The creation of an image that can be split into a puzzle for piecemeal acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://directionwithintent.com/images/stylish_ensemble_300x300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although publicity and marketing would be rare things in Diderot’s time, nowadays they are indispensable tools for most of us PMs.
Consider those innocent images of a stylish laptop on a working desk, surrounded by other good looking items that might not even be at the same technological level. That old looking leather bag? The vintage camera? The open and scribbled moleskin? You can buy all on the online store link right beside the image. Why not add to cart directly from the picture? One by one until you can reproduce the image at your own volition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another aspect of this ideal image is that it can be mixed and matched with other elements. It can become your unique image, instead of being a copy that any other consumer can get. The entrapment needs not only one view of the desired environment but a variety of elements for a wide range of collages, each one depicting the beautiful moments that the consumer will experience with a similar set of items.
The ensemble exclusivity attribute will avoid the feeling of making a collection of mass-produced items that only require perseverance and a deep enough pocket in exchange for a vulgar lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;digital-diderot&quot;&gt;Digital Diderot&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within digital worlds, we can see more and more applications of these principles to keep the user acquiring more virtual goods, coin by coin. Although we associate this behaviour to younger demographics, this is only because we are growing with the technology. I wouldn’t be surprised to see retirees with disposable income, become escapees in virtual realms for fun and glory, flashing their cyber bling, renewed at each software upgrade.
Another very appealing aspect within the digital environments is the fact that you can be much more volatile regarding the self-identity that you want to imprint on the remaining participants. Cheaper acquisitions that provide sex, ethnic or even race mutations. The liberty to move between Diderot units is much larger than in reality, which benefits not only the digital market creator but also the products created to live within that market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-long-tail-strikes-again&quot;&gt;The long tail strikes again.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the niches. Those are always a good target for the strategy. Take the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Japanese culture fans will drop their savings into remarkable pieces of serial-produced art of their favourite characters.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copy-paste my last sentence and replace Japanese culture with Marvel, DC, Star Wars, Pokemon, et al.
Some of them are authentic art collections, I’ll give you that, but it’s almost trivial to take advantage of the effect on the fans.
Royalties and deals for the copyright are expensive? You can always get creative like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.qwertee.com/&quot;&gt;Qwertee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;on-novelties&quot;&gt;On Novelties&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you only have a single product? A novelty type.
Take as an example a &lt;a href=&quot;https://gopro.com/en/us/&quot;&gt;GoPro&lt;/a&gt; camera some years ago or the latest abs machine from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.qvc.com/&quot;&gt;QVC&lt;/a&gt; as novelty examples.
Applying the effect on this type of product is a bit harder but not impossible. I’ve already provided one of the most important conditions that you need to respect. Your product needs to mingle almost seamlessly with an assorted set of products, and ideally, it should be possible to do it in different contexts. A GoPro camera is an excellent example. From competitive fishing to skydiving, the camera is the same, although the lifestyle and accessories differ. Diderot units can be very different, but the way that GoPro’s marketing campaign placed the camera in different stories making it an essential piece that increases the reward of the experience is an example to copy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://directionwithintent.com/images/school_300x300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s imagine an innovative hand sanitizer bottle. If you’re trying to appeal to parents and kids, maybe you can introduce it on a picture where the classroom material such as pens, glue, pencil and sharpener are all over the table and shared by his friends. In the mix, add a colourful hand sanitizer so that the dirty play stays on the table and doesn’t travel back on the child’s pockets to your pristine home&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, I’m creating a very speculative scenario, but the principle is that your novelty product, in this case, can be selected for the student lifestyle. It’s a valuable item that will have a positive effect on the usual ensemble of school paraphernalia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exercise can be repeated over and over for multiple scenarios and targets with the same objective. Create a picture where your product merges with the background and don’t be afraid of spreading the publicity between products. Insert your product in already existing Diderot units and take advantage of the spending momentum of the consumer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;complementary-goods-not-really&quot;&gt;Complementary Goods? Not really.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An Economist would suggest that this is a direct application of a (complementary good)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementary_good], but a more observant thinker notices that it isn’t a requirement and probably isn’t a good fit for the term.
Just as an example, consider rolling tobacco and papers. The demand for the first is highly correlated with the demand of the second, which in turn will create a price correlation as well. This is an almost perfect example of a complementary good.
While the correlation between these two products is evident, even considering fringe uses of both, a direct correlation between complex sets of products that benefit from the Diderot’s effect isn’t required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t need to create a complementary good ( and it would be harder to coordinate product requirements ), but you should compose the environment where the perceived value or even the return of investment of your product will go up when seen within a collection. And this last sentence segue to another aspect that doesn’t need to be present, but it will help for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tag-team-for-the-win&quot;&gt;Tag-team for the win&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re up to date on your pop-culture trivia, you might recognize the next one. 
Did you ever notice that charm of a staged house or indeed just a bedroom in an IKEA store?  On the set, if you inspect each item closely by itself, you start losing the interest from few of the more average things, but if you take a few steps back and see the ensemble, it appears that the whole gets an added layer of glossy veneer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The Cheerleader effect)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheerleader_effect] provides a hypothesis with a more sexual tone in the experiments which I’ve tried to avoid in my example. The effect is definitely controverse since it isn’t replicable in any conditions, but I wouldn’t discard it so soon since the result is real on some cultures and contexts.
The idea seems simple, and it’s mostly an advertising trick. Ensemble images that include your product in between some other attractive buying options will boost the subjective attractiveness index that someone attaches to it. It should be possible to exploit it with some simple A/B testing techniques, and fine-tune the index to the final consumer group.
Unmistakably, you should avoid the pitfalls of trying to mingle products for different classes of consumers. Don’t try to take pictures of your hand sanitizer in a Ferrari. Your effort to make it more appealing will be blatant and will backfire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;jumping-diderot-units&quot;&gt;Jumping Diderot Units&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To finish this analysis, there is another aspect that a product manager should understand when introducing new products that don’t shake the paradigm and are only marginal improvements of existing ones.
Considering Diderot’s tale again, one can see clearly that the gown didn’t introduce an objective improvement in the author’s life. One might argue about some minor enhancements regarding comfort but accepting the story as it is, even Diderot’s grants that his old gown was a more superior fit for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Why didn’t I keep it? It was used to me and I was used to it. It molded all the folds of my body without inhibiting it; I was picturesque and handsome. The other one is stiff, and starchy, makes me look stodgy.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the first act of change was a trigger for his final sorrow. In between, he got the room that fitted the gown. It wasn’t something new that he introduced in his environment but a change of the old for the new.
We don’t know if it was an impulse buy or even a gift, but it could be left aside and ignored so to avoid disruption in his house. He accepted the change and identified himself with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming back to our study, let us consider that your newly introduced product actually brings an objective improvement that is measurable, and you can point it out to your potential customers. Let us imagine a futuristic desk light that not only adjusts automatically to the ambient light but also follows your vision field whenever you move your head to inspect if someone is creeping beside you while you’re reading a horror story in your bedroom. It even will turn itself on and off according to your eyelid patterns. Cool hum? You see a benefit right from the start comparing it with your night lamp, but unfortunately, the design doesn’t match your old furniture style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, the consumer considers if a single appealing item, apparently useful, but not useful enough to disrupt his furniture state of affairs.
To burst the surface tension, you’ll need to appeal to the inspirational instinct of the buyer.  He needs to see the change at that moment and invest in the modernization of his environment. As I’ve mentioned earlier in the text, the luxury pieces in Diderot’s room had already been seeded by existing high society tastes. Those are the ones that you’ll need to take from the current world around you to create the most bleeding-edge image where everything around the desk light is a requirement for life itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating an inspirational context around a product is evidently tricky, and so it is that making the consumer jumping between Diderot’s unit ( in the real world where he has skin in the game ) it’s one of the most challenging manoeuvres to do when it comes to his real self-expression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summing up,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Understand that a Diderot unit needs to be seeded in the mind of the consumer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The digital selves are an excellent target for consumers since the notion of self-identity is prone to volatility. No skin in the game makes this possible.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The long tail can become a marketeer target again with this strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Novelties can take advantage of the effect as well as long as the product manager is willing to share the stage with others.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Complementary goods isn’t a good description of elements in a Diderot unit. They don’t need to be directly correlated.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Exploit the Cheerleader Effect with A/B  testing of your image ensembles.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Resistance to change is inherently human, so don’t expect to break momentum but try to use the consumer inertia in your advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;This one was written amid a pandemic. The hand sanitizer exercise isn’t innocent. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hortator, an Antiquity word for the modern times</title>

        	&lt;p&gt;Hortator, a Latin word meaning “one who encourages.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Header and teaser image&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; use was kindly authorized by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cngcoins.com/&quot;&gt;Classical Numismatic Group, LLC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Antiquity and until the end of the XVI century, the Galley boat dominated the Mediterranean. One of the most visible aspects of this type of boat is the parallel lines of rows on each side. Inside the Galley, you would find the manpower that pushed the behemoths between Mediterranean shores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Galley structure was diverse, but a usual architecture for large ones would put the oarsmen below the deck or below an elevated platform that supported officials and troops.
Two or more lines of men on each side, in a coordinated effort, propelled the ship with the sweat of the brow.
It was a strenuous and muscular work for sure and anyone that tried to row, even on a static one, knows that it isn’t a child’s play. Anyone that had the chance of experiencing a canoe ride, whether using a row on each side or a single one with two paddles, notices that body coordination is as essential as the strength that you put on the push of the paddle. The row should hit the water with the thinnest area possible and exit the same way. In between the surface area of the paddle should face the force of the water and push it behind.
Not an easy skill for a  single rower. Now multiply that by 10, 30 or even 170 like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trireme&quot;&gt;trireme&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Roman empire heyday, when their navy still meant something, (although not that much) and mainly during wartime, galley rowers were lower-ranking roman citizens, colonists and freeman. Rowing within this type of boat wasn’t a task that you could throw forced labour upon. The coordination of the job required training, discipline and equilibrium between lines. In dire times when citizens weren’t enough to fill the seats, drafting slaves would be the last option and rarely done. The oarsmen should be focused on the mission of the boat and committed with the general effort. If a large group of able men wasn’t committed to the ship’s goal and became distressed with the mission, it might mean a disaster waiting to happen.
Greeks showed the path on how to staff a Galley. Romans followed. 
But as you might imagine, even with rigorous row training, coordinate so many hands required ongoing supervision and direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Front and centre, between the two lines of men, you would find the Hortator. The maestro of oarsmen. As stated at the beginning of this piece, Hortator is a word with Latin origin, and it’s best translated as “the one who encourages”. You’ll find few references to the function and some other names such as Pausarius.  But for the intrepid Mediterraneans, it fits the job spec perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His mission was to mark the pace of the row, set direction and execute complex manoeuvres with some type of musical instrument for coordinating row stride. Greeks were known to use the flute, but there aren’t many Roman depictions of the oarsman coordination. Nevertheless, Hollywood imprinted the image of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ax7wcShvrus&quot;&gt;drummer&lt;/a&gt; marking the pace that you’ll also find corroborated by more reputable sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, it was impossible to adjust each man speed and row. Lines should be well versed in the technique and muscle trimmed for endurance. Strength equilibrium couldn’t be planned ahead by only organizing lines at the beginning of a trip. The effort of a line needed to be averaged out and the Hortator would need to understand which side to favour with slight delays between each stroke while keeping a good momentum. Understanding the levels of energy of the Galley crew was fundamental for reaching any port without exhausting the oarsman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, it is quite probable that an Hortator would find himself with a scarce view of the sea around the ship and would have to rely on the orders of the captaincy officials combined with is internal positioning ability. Even with a less protected structure were rowers and the Hortator would be exposed to open sky, his attention needed to be divided between the top brass orders, his positional awareness and the performance of the rowing crew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now imagine all of the above amid a battle.
Speed would be critical on these moments, but with short bursts at a time or else no energy would be available for close engagements after boarding enemy ships. Victory or defeat could depend on the energy reservoirs of the Galley oarsman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve bear with me up to this point, I hope you’ll also found a set of characteristics that are essential for the newcome product leads or even for intermediary leadership positions were junior management is put up to the test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The process should be as simple as a combination of sounds that mark the pace.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Technical teams on the trenches need a guiding force that can coordinate the effort consistently without adjusting each member at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moments of high speed should be in short bursts, and only when the time to market means war.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stamina and strength need to be balanced.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vison is hampered on all sides. Your internal compass is fundamental.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hortator is definitely a word that should be recycled for our modern times and a title befitting to the successful leader that strives right where the action takes place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From time to time you’ll ear this one (or a variant of) in a discussion for some in-house innovation project that requires guidance whether from the armchair or crowd. It poses as the checkmate move from the belief side of the argument, uttered by a product executive, manager and defended by those without the decision responsibility, where the hubris is strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forget the sentence’s author and focus on the argument itself ( it’s always the best option ).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it really possible to create something amazing for your potential users that could be a paradigm shift on solving one or even more of their problems and doesn’t require any input from any prospect? Or maybe something more humble but still a change for the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final user priors aren’t a requirement to build a successful product. Examples of ideas from the ether abound, and it will not be hard to find grand narratives of individualistic creativity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, the idea fails fast. This is a good scenario for everyone but don’t think that it is over yet. “I’m just ahead of time” and “just you wait and
see” will be your pause button of the discussion. “I told you so” will be the play action in a far future when something reasonably similar makes the cut. Authorities will excuse themselves of failure using this rhetoric. This one is oh so pernicious because the listener might fall for the narrative fallacy trap and start believing that the messiah is real.
In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/840.The_Design_of_Everyday_Things&quot;&gt;“The Design of Everyday Things”&lt;/a&gt; you’ll find an excellent example but I will not spoil it. Take a look and get back to me if you find it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is always a but right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For developing products, services, companies or truly world impacting ideas, that aren’t only ideology, you don’t need and you shouldn’t play probabilities from the armchair. You can eschew random choices and skew your path in the direction of the best available scenarios.
How to do it? There is enough literature to help you with that and I would add very little to it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/13348394-nuno-valente?shelf=product-syllabus&quot;&gt;My product syllabus&lt;/a&gt; reading list might be overwhelming at first but I would point as a starting point &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/762542.The_Four_Steps_to_the_Epiphany&quot;&gt;“The Four Steps to the Epiphany: Successful Strategies for Startups That Win“&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ratio of one success for each ten tries that Steve Blank mentions should be enough of a deterrent to avoid going all in with your future product. Due diligence may help avoid that one to ten and make it a miserable three in ten but surely you can see the better deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t be the victim of your belief in the survivors. Avoid the product hero who’s tunnel vision doesn’t see failure in his path. Go find your clients before they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/07/28/ford-faster-horse&quot;&gt;There is no evidence that Henry Ford said or written those words.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

        	&lt;img src=&quot;https://directionwithintent.com/images/peg_1600x800.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        	&lt;p&gt;In the Greek Mythology, Procrustes posed as a gentle caretaker, offered accommodation to any passing traveller. After an invitation for a satisfying meal, he provided a good night’s rest in his exceptional bed. Procrustes described it as having the unique property that its length exactly matched whomsoever lay down upon it. What Procrustes didn’t volunteer was the method by which this “one-size-fits-all” was achieved, namely as soon as the guest lay down Procrustes went to work upon him, stretching him on the rack if he was too short for the bed and chopping off his legs if he was too long. (Adapted from Procrustes — MythWeb (http://www.mythweb.com/teachers/why/basics/procrustes.html))&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a Product Management position, one can imagine the many procrustean beds that are built for the private residents, i.e., engineering, quality assurance, operations, sales, etc. or for the passing traveller such as prospect trials, consultants, brokers and, existing clients. Let us refer to them as internal if they are to be fitted for in-house stakeholders, or external if they “accommodate” visitors that aren’t part of the company inner circle.
In this series, I’m going to focus on the external ones and mostly derived from my experience in B2B environments. The ones that may hinder revenue goals directly and create friction in the overall evolution of the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prospect client’s trial is a moment of utmost importance and, especially when a product or service has a broad and/or complex feature base. It doesn’t stand for itself. It needs an attentive caretaker that invites the freshly arrived visitor to have the best possible experience and, that can steer him on how to take advantage of the available amenities. Eager as we are, to make an excellent first impression and, to close the deal in the shortest amount of time ( because trials always have a cost ) we invite the user to feel at ease and at the same time we push him to experiment our star features. With the least amount of effort, we show him how to achieve our product promised outcomes. While the caretaker and the user roam around, showcasing the product end to end and iterating over the feature spectrum, we fall into the mistake of force fitting the client to the feature, whether the use case applies or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it should be expected of a product team, we want and need to be creative. We seek inspiration in every problem that we face but sometimes, repeating empty metaphors such as “thinking outside the box”. And regrettably, we try to find solutions on the spot, for the prospect client workflows, habits and, tools, that are allegedly defective, unorganised, inexistent, &lt;insert another=&quot;&quot; problem=&quot;&quot; here=&quot;&quot;&gt;. On the other hand, a small void or even a domain that we’ve managed to exclude from our road-map can bring havoc when a client merely hints the fact of nonexistent work in that regard. Instead, we should take our notes and seclude our selfs, for a moment, where we can summon our creativity and muster our planning abilities towards a well-designed solution. On the spot, thinking and instant client fitting is the moments where we start amputating the prospect expectations and with the best of intentions in mind but ignoring the prospect client true needs and creating product fragilities. Doing this we fall into an uberous mind trap. Let’s delve into one type of this situations. The dreadful and pernicious Workaround.&lt;/insert&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Workaround&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a well-known term in the Engineering class and many times used ad nauseam. Whether it is the best option at a time of need, laziness, schedule compression, damage control or just a temporary patch. It is a well-known term in the engineering class and many times used ad nauseam. Whether it is the best option at a time of need, laziness, schedule compression, damage control or just a temporary patch. A seasoned Software Engineer evidently used it on several occasions and sometimes wakes a night, shivering with the memories of some that still work on a machine somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Product Development, the Workaround has a very similar set of characteristics. It is some process or small addition that will leverage an alternative pathway of one or more features to attain, what we believe to be a quick win. Sometimes with the objective of solving an unexpected user need or capricious desire. Sometimes it’s a cover up of an edge case that the product team did not address correctly or just ignored because they’ve fallen into a pseudo-statistical fallacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Workaround trigger usually occurs in a commercial or technical tour of the product. May it be a sincere question that has a genuine need behind or a more technical person that wants to show off his wits. Occasionally can be a snarky remark that may compare his current work environment or another tool that he tried recently with our own, and something is definitely missing in his eyes.
The fear and anxiety of not being able to entertain the user, makes us create a parallel thread with a request that the product team scramble the issue searching a way to meet our client expectations. It should not be a problem if at that moment a backlog entry is dutifully filled with a good picture of the issue, that popped up from the conversation, and a reasonable amount of time is taken to consider the proposition. It is a problem when we bypass our product development processes, and the proposed solution involves small feature adjustments that didn’t pass a thorough impact analysis. It is a problem when even avoiding the most minor alteration, it is the result of a collage of one or more features, or maybe, just making use of a feature quirk and painting it as a fully fledged product of human ingenuity. Unfortunately, the Workaround, most of the times results in a non-fluid and/or semi-automatic action plan, requiring the user to withstand some pain or to exert himself to do the same thing that he did or have seen in action before. At the exit of the Workaround, we claim victory if a significant amount of work that the user already does in a streamlined fashion or seen it being executed in the same way can be achieved in our product. We think that we’ve kept the user going, but we don’t see that the user is limping on its way. It may take just a small extra effort to vindicate the capabilities of our product but at the cost of an amputation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the attentive and sharp reader, another Procrustean Bed can be found A Posteriori. At the exit of the Workaround and this one with the bed and victim roles switched. This one can kill our product vision and eventually our product. Remember that for the Workaround to be put in place, some small change in our product had to be made. Even when we’ve just managed to pipeline a feature output to another as input, and with some caretaker good will. We’ve adjusted our product to fit that particular prospect or even client need at that precise moment in time without measuring the consequences of those actions. Expectations were created, and new plumbing was added disregarding our architecture, use cases and requirements. To do this, we’ve amputated, rearranged, bypassed and plug it again changing our product morphology. Again, with the best of intentions, to show how exceptional is our team and product. If we exit the Workaround multiple times, it is granted that our product will die in the bed that was made with our client’s hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Workaround is avoidable, and it should be considered an anti-pattern in product development and management. It is damaging for our client prospects, and it is deadly for our product. Take the necessary precautions when you meet with the prospect of a Workaround and make time for fixing it before the product vitality seeps out from all of those newly created ins and outs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you know more Procrustean Beds in Product Development and Management? Leave your comments and let’s have a chat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Procrustean services and products on the wild&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reading this piece one might wonder that no procrustean bed should be a success since it destroys vital parts of the client work, team, company, etc. The reality is quite different and a quick inspection of our surroundings with this thought in mind will show us that sometimes people jump into those beds and accept the punishment in exchange of some promise of greatness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter is an excellent example of a procrustean bed. In this type of services, critical mass has a bandwagon effect that, most of the users aren’t even forced to lay their content on it, while amputating themselves in colorful headlines that the arbitrary 140 character limit can contain. All of them with the fear of missing out the short exposure and afraid that they will not be a part of a vaporous and fleeting zeitgeist.&lt;/p&gt;

        	&lt;h2 id=&quot;apple-prison-more-like-apple-island&quot;&gt;Apple Prison? More like Apple Island.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four years ago, give or take a few months, I’ve changed my work and home machines to Apple systems, abandoning the mixed Windows/Linux environments that accompanied me since high school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a quick change fueled by a couple of teammates and the fact that I’ve bought an iPhone a few months earlier. All my Windows machines were dead or in need of repair, and I was just sick of the finicky Vista that was installed by default in my current machine at that time. Those were dark times for Microsoft OSs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The change was made, and some months later, I was sold entirely to Apple Software and Hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my favourite things about Apple is the seamless integration of all its products. Connecting my iPhone to my MacBook Pro and easily sync my data between devices, even though iTunes isn’t the best interface to accomplish my syncing needs. Also, the iCloud option for backing up my “mobile data” is noteworthy, although one needs to keep the data hygiene for the free tier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I’m a victim of the mid-2010 MacBook Pro, but even so, the combination of Apple software and hardware bring a level of reliability, far above average. Recently, I also boasted of my 127-day uptime to my teammates that usually restart their machines now and then. I know that any *nix user out there will claim even longer uptimes, but with a maintenance cost that I don’t want to pay every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, I own a late-2013 MacBook Pro with retina display, 512 GB SSD drive plus a DDR3 memory total of 16 Gb. Obviously, this isn’t a machine that the everyday user will take advantage of, but for an I.T. professional like me, this is undoubtedly one of the best machines that my money could buy. Add the current Apple option of upgrading OSX free from charge, and you have a system that can last for four or more years without the need for a drastic and expensive upgrade. As my fellow Software Engineers out there, I love to tinker with my hardware and software occasionally, but that’s it. My machine is to work on, and not to bring me extra work just to keep it updated and running smoothly. I have joy and fun hacking away…But I would instead not do it every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I need any piece of software for my tool belt, I just hit a few search queries, and the App Store provides. Even though I don’t actually know the people and processes that Apple uses to accept a new App in their store, I always have a sense of security of the available products. Having at least a primary barrier against mediocre software prevents the application spam that other vendors suffer from their so-called openness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And because of the above reasons and so many more, many people would say that Apple software is evil for creating a prison that they cannot leave or decorate on their terms. In my opinion, this is not really a prison, but an exotic island where I can live happily without the diseases spreading on the continent. As a bonus, I can live knowing that the environment is cared, groomed and curated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;above-and-beyond&quot;&gt;Above and beyond&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No man is an island” is a well-known quote and truth. We need to communicate and interact with others to grow, evolve, and produce something that everybody can be proud of. For this to happen, we need to leave our beautiful Island and interact with the harsh environment out there. In this area, I need to champion Google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Drive/Docs combination is fantastic, for me, my team and, several stakeholders of the projects where I’m currently committed to. The aforementioned pair brings a powerful tool to keep our product backlog stories, specs and assorted meeting minutes. Documents are edited concurrently between me (under the hat of team lead), a designer team account and a product owner. All these while ideas float around the meeting table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drive accommodates much storage giving us the sense that it is an infinite local share. I just hope that Google invests in improving Docs and Drive interfaces up to the level of most of Apple software. Now and then I need to restructure my Docs and Drive area, but the current interface surely needs refinements and a good UI/UX boost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gmail is widespread, and Inbox is a step forward in solving the current email hell. My personal mail account is Gmail, and the company where I’m currently working has Gmail from their beginnings. I can’t remember a day that Google cloud services failed and caused embarrassment on my company services and processes. Add Google Chat on the mail interface and instantly kill many unnecessary email exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So “Google” reads all my emails? No problem, my friend. If I need to pay those services only by receiving targeted publicity (in a very discrete manner), then please do. Avoid sending me those ads for car rims that I do not care and sell me the smallest pocket wallet on the market. In the middle of that insurmountable pile of data, I’m a male 25–35 years old that is a geek and sports lover. My personal data is protected by numbers that grow every day just as though a flock survives predators with sheer confusion of Agile movement and bird count.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-environment&quot;&gt;My environment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monopoly is a game that I loved to play when I was a kid and even nowadays is a well-spent night with friends, but it is very dangerous in the real world. I hope that none of these companies can achieve a market position that can dry all of their competitors completely, but right now I choose to spend some years in this lovely Apple island with a Google cloudy sky.&lt;/p&gt;

        	&lt;img src=&quot;https://directionwithintent.com/images/jruby_1600x800.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        	&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, I was developing a couple of extensions for &lt;a href=&quot;http://logstash.net/&quot;&gt;Logstash&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my input extensions connected to a SQLServer via JDBC driver and it all worked fine in my OSX machine. But then, an evil Red Hat Enterprise server appeared, took over the control of my processes and started to mess with all of my good JVM configurations (some of them, I didn’t even know that they existed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some suffering, anger and hunger that all debugging processes bring, I’ve found an ancient JVM flag that my evil Red Hat server changed, just to see me cry, after several bad relationships with an assorted number of encodings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sun.io.unicode.encoding=UnicodeBig (good OSX)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sun.io.unicode.encoding=UnicodeLittle ( evil Red Hat)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loading up my JVM with -J-Dsun.io.unicode.encoding=UnicodeLittle saved the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, if you ever want to check your encoding flags just add this to your JRuby script:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;require 'java'

java_import java.util.Locale
java_import java.util.Properties
java_import java.util.Enumeration
java_import java.lang.System

{assorted code}

p = System.getProperties();
keys = p.keys();
keys.each do |key|
  value = p.get(key);
  puts &quot;#{key} : #{value}&quot;
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this script, you can print all of your JVM instance flags. Have fun!&lt;/p&gt;
